**Jerod Santo:** Welcome, friends. This is Frontend Feud, everyone's favorite award-worthy game show, made by the award-winning JS Party Podcast that you're listening to this very moment. I'm Jerod Santo, and I'd like to thank all 100 of our savvy, tasteful, good-looking audience members for taking the time to take the survey which makes this game possible.

After dethroning the Shop Talk guys last time we played, Una Kravets and Adam Argyle are back from the CSS Podcast, defending their title. Welcome to the show!

**Una Kravets:** Wooh!

**Adam Argyle:** Thank you.

**Una Kravets:** Let's see if we can go two for two.

**Jerod Santo:** We shall see, we shall see. And our challengers - we have David and Shaw from The Keyframers show. Welcome, guys.

**David Khourshid:** Hey, thanks for having us.

**Shaw:** Thanks for having us. Ah, jinx.

**David Khourshid:** Jinx. \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** They're already on the same page. This is a problem, Adam. \[laughter\]

**Shaw:** That may not work if we're trying to sync up on what the audience is thinking though...

**David Khourshid:** Exactly.

**Jerod Santo:** That's true. Now, I've been told that it's customary in game shows to take a moment and get to know each of our contestants... But I didn't really have time to prep for this, so I asked our intern Larry to do some research and write up a question, one for each of you, which I'll read now.

So Una, do you remember the first time you rode a bike without training wheels?

**Una Kravets:** Hah... I do remember.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, thank you. Adam. \[laughter\] Who is your daddy, and what does he do?

**Adam Argyle:** "I'm a cop, you idiot!" \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** David, I'm told you play the piano?

**David Khourshid:** I do.

**Jerod Santo:** Where do you think \[unintelligible 00:04:16.08\] gets those fancy outfits he wears on stage?

**David Khourshid:** Oh, I don't know... He probably coordinates with Billy Joel. I have no idea.

**Jerod Santo:** Good answer. Shaw, do you like apples?

**Shaw:** Yeah... Yeah, they're pretty good.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I got her number. How do you like the -- Larry, that's terrible. That's not even a question. \[laughter\] Gosh... Let's just move on, let's move on to our game, which as you know, is not a game about how much frontend or JavaScript or developer information you all have in your heads, it's how well you know the life of a developer, the choices, the answers that our listening audience put into those textboxes on the survey.

So here's how it works... We have six rounds, of course, two teams, each round has a gameboard in which we have a statement, followed by the top-matching answers, highest to lowest. Your job is to match the highest-ranking answers, accumulate points, and the team with the most points at the end of six rounds wins.

Now, each round starts with what we call an interface-off, because we love puns, in which one person from each team steps up and gets to guess first. The person who matches the highest-ranking answer on the board during that time gets to take the round, and their team plays that entire round until three strikes occur, at which point the other team can steal the points in the round with one guess.

Now, there's no conferring between you and your teammate during the regular round, but during the steal y'all can talk, decide, and figure out which steal you're gonna play. Any questions?

**Shaw:** When does Steve Harvey get here? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:06:01.03\] You're looking at him. I'm your Steve Harvey today. I apologize in advance... This is as good as it's going to get. Alright, first up in our interface-off, it is David vs. Una. Step right up.

**Una Kravets:** Woo-hoo!

**David Khourshid:** Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo...!

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, ladies first... Una, we asked 100 JS Party listeners "Which server-side JavaScript runtime do they expect to be using three years from now?" What do you suppose was their response?

**Una Kravets:** Hmm, a runtime... So is this like Node.js? Because that's been pretty popular for a long time, and likely will continue.

**Jerod Santo:** Is that your answer?

**Una Kravets:** Yes, that's my final answer...

**Jerod Santo:** Final answer?

**Una Kravets:** Final answer...

**Jerod Santo:** Survey says... \[win alert\] That is the number one answer.

**Una Kravets:** Wooh!!

**Jerod Santo:** So 43 of 100 said they will be using Node three years from now. So that means David does not get a chance; I apologize, but Una stole the board... And now Team CSS Podcast gets to play. There are four total answers on the board; you've got the number one answer, and you now need to find the other three.

I shall say, in order to make it on the board, an answer must have at least five responses. So you may match something that somebody said, but we had to have five people say it for it to make the board. So, CSS Podcast is live...

**Una Kravets:** This is a hard one... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** It's Adam's turn. There's three left; you already have Node. Which server-side JS runtime do people expect to be using three years from now?"

**Adam Argyle:** The one I just built my site on top of - Deno.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Deno. \[win alert\] It is on there. Let's find out where it is.

**David Khourshid:** You can't just rearrange letters... It's cheating.

**Jerod Santo:** In fact, number two! 30 respondents said they'd be using Deno three years from now. Very good.

**Adam Argyle:** I've got another one. Is this on Una, or --

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it goes back to her now, so you'll have another chance...

**Una Kravets:** It goes back to me.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it toggles back and forth till we get three strikes. You're halfway there, but there are two responses left. What do you think, Una?

**Una Kravets:** God, I don't know... Server-side runtime. I don't even know if this is server-side runtime, but I know that there is a tool that's been growing in popularity, which has server-side rendering; I just don't know if this is a runtime, or accounts -- because it's a server. But this is what runs a server, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Remember that the answers for the survey were completely based on the interpretation of the question by the survey takers. So they can take it however they want. I can't clarify what I meant, because it meant something different to everybody. So go ahead and guess, and see what you can do.

**Una Kravets:** God, this is gonna be wrong... This is gonna be wrong, but for some reason -- I'm thinking Vite. But that's not a server-side runtime. But anyway...

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Vite... \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, but yes, that is incorrect. So you now have one strike against you, and we go back to Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** I'll say Bun. Show me some Buns.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Buns. \[win alert\] Bun is on the list, number four, with seven responses. So now we have Node at number one, Deno at number two, number three is a question mark, and Bun with seven. You have one strike, so two more wrong guesses before a steal. Una, we're back to you.

**Una Kravets:** Okay, so I'm thinking with things like Node being very popular, maybe people are thinking along those lines, so maybe people are thinking of like -- everything I'm thinking of is a framework on top of a runtime, that's the problem... This is a hard one. Dang, my next thought goes like "Oh, what if it's something like Express, if they're thinking about Node but they're not sure what the right answer is here?" But that's not a runtime, it's a framework that you use on top of Node. Can I phone a friend? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** We will need some sort of a guess...

**Shaw:** Different show.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a different show. We do not have that kind of budget around here.

**Una Kravets:** What about Adam? Adam is my friend...

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:10:07.22\] Well, you can get one wrong and it'll be back to him. He gets another chance. So you can just guess whatever you like... Remember, it's what they said, it's not what is correct.

**Una Kravets:** That's true... I'll guess Express, but I just know that's probably not it. Unless it is...

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Express... \[fail alert\]

**Una Kravets:** Ugh...

**Jerod Santo:** It is not Express. I will say that there was at least one response that was Express... So you were not completely wrong... But not five.

**Una Kravets:** No, I was wrong. I knew that I was wrong.

**Jerod Santo:** I was trying to throw you a bone. Two strikes... Back to Adam. Okay, this is it. You've got one on the board... What do you think people said to this question about JS runtimes three years from now?

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, so I'm just gonna go with the first one that I wrote down; I'm not sure if it's totally it, but... And maybe there's multiple terms, but it's either Cloudflare Workers or Edge Workers in general. So just running your servers at the edge, in a serverless function.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, show us Edge Workers. \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, that is also not on the board. We now have an opportunity to steal. There's 80 points up for grabs... So Keyframers guys, if you steal this, you get the 80, plus the correct answer. If you don't, the 80 goes to Una and Adam and we move on.

**David Khourshid:** Oh, gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** So you get one guess. You can discuss together...

**Una Kravets:** Fingers crossed.

**Jerod Santo:** ...that number three slot - what is it? What is it?

**Shaw:** What are you thinking, David?

**David Khourshid:** I mean, I was also thinking Cloudflare Workers... But there has to be something else obvious that we're not thinking of.

**Shaw:** Web Assembly is the only thing that's coming to mind for me...

**David Khourshid:** You know what - yeah. I think that's a -- let's go for it. That's a good guess.

**Shaw:** Web Assembly, final answer.

**Jerod Santo:** For the steal, Web Assembly. \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, but it was not Web Assembly... Which means CSS Podcast is awarded 80 points.

**Una Kravets:** See, this is the luck aspect...

**Jerod Santo:** And we will now see what is that magical number three.

**Shaw:** It's not io.js, right?

**David Khourshid:** Is it Bazel, or something?

**Jerod Santo:** One thing you have to know about JS Party listeners is they love to reject the premise of the question. The answer is none. They do not see themselves using a JS runtime.

**Una Kravets:** I was trying to answer with the rejection of the premise as well... \[laughs\]

**David Khourshid:** What if they just misspelled Node?

**Jerod Santo:** Ooh, also a possibility... Eight people misspelled Node...

**Una Kravets:** They're just a few keyboard clicks away...

**Shaw:** Didn't one just show up though after Bun? Like, Bun got their funding, and I thought somebody else showed up recently, that's like another fast -- and I couldn't remember what it was, but maybe I'm confusing it with...

**Una Kravets:** What about browser-based JS runtimes?

**Jerod Santo:** No, it didn't make the list. A few other runners-up - so three people said Remix, two said Astro, one person said Ruby on Rails...

**Shaw:** Yeah, but those are frameworks...

**Una Kravets:** This is the same problem... Not runtimes...

**Jerod Santo:** It's the same problem. And one person said "An unreleased Go framework", which I think they're gonna be releasing, or something... But that's what they're gonna be using three years from now.

**Una Kravets:** You heard it here first.

**Jerod Santo:** So you heard it here first. Alright, that brings us to round two... So after the first round, CSS Podcast holds on to their 80 points. We now move to round two, and our interface-off is between Shaw and Adam. Step right up.

**Adam Argyle:** Ooh... Brothers from another mother.

**Shaw:** Let's go.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we'll let Shaw go first on this one... The question is "Every big tech company wants to hire you. Compensation is identical. Which do you choose?" There are five answers on the board. Shaw, we go to you.

**Shaw:** Man, that's tough. What does the audience think, is the question... I'm gonna go with Apple.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Apple. \[win alert\] You are correct, and it is the number one answer, with 21 respondents choosing Apple, which means, Keyframers, you get to play this round, and we go to David for Another guess.

**David Khourshid:** \[00:14:04.08\] Awesome. Well, running through the FAANG, MANGA, whatever we wanna call it, I would say another one would be - I just came from Microsoft, so... I don't know if that's the obvious one though. Oh, oh, um -- man, is OpenAI a big...? You know what - let's go with the obvious first. Microsoft.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Microsoft. \[win alert\] Number two answer, with 18. Very nice. Back to you, Shaw. We are now rolling in round two.

**David Khourshid:** I'm gonna say Google is definitely on there.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Google. \[win alert\] Number three answer. 13 points to you, sir. Very well played.

**Una Kravets:** Going down the list.

**Shaw:** Do we get extra points for going in order...?

**Jerod Santo:** You get kudos from me. You have the top three. Four and five - of course, it gets more difficult as you get further down, because there's lots of big tech companies to guess from. David, what are you thinking?

**David Khourshid:** I was gonna say Amazon, but that's like -- the only reason you would work there is for the compensation, no offence... But if it's identical, then -- you know what, let's do Netflix. That's a big one.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Netflix. \[win alert\] Number five answer. Very good. So you lost your purity in order, but you did not lose your purity in guesses. So your four for four. There's one left. Number four is still open. Zero strikes against you. So you have three guesses at this before a steal.

**Shaw:** Man, I wouldn't want to work there, but Meta/Facebook is probably on the list somewhere... Mostly because of their React development. I'm sure people wanna be a part of...

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Meta... \[fail alert\] Strike number one. Not in the top five. David, back to you.

**Shaw:** Good on you, audience. \[laughter\]

**David Khourshid:** Alright, let's go with the obvious... Amazon.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Amazon. \[fail alert\] Amazon had three, but didn't quite make the top five.

**David Khourshid:** Geez...

**Jerod Santo:** Now we have two strikes and we're down to our last guess. Una and Adam, start thinking about a steal.

**Shaw:** Okay, what else is in the acronym...? Man, I'm not even thinking of any other top companies...

**David Khourshid:** Am I allowed to help, or...? If we're on the same team.

**Jerod Santo:** Not at this point. During a steal, you can help.

**David Khourshid:** Okay.

**Shaw:** Yeah, so it's not Amazon, it's not Meta... And GitHub's a part of Microsoft, so that -- did you combine audience answers into...?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. GitHub is Microsoft, yes.

**Shaw:** Okay. Geez... Let's go with OpenAI. I'm sure there's some interest out there.

**Jerod Santo:** OpenAI - is it in that number four slot? Survey says... \[fail alert\] No, it is not. I'm sorry, but you did not clear the board, and so now we have an opportunity to steal from CSS Podcast... And you guys can discuss, so what are you thinking?

**Una Kravets:** I'm thinking that this is a benefits-based answer probably. That's kind of where my head's at.

**Adam Argyle:** I'm thinking about where everybody just left these big companies... Where did they all go? What was the number one spot, if you did work at Apple, Microsoft, Google - where did you bounce? Who stole everyone recently?

**David Khourshid:** Apple fired no one...

**Adam Argyle:** Apple fired no one. I think that's why they're on top, honestly.

**Una Kravets:** Yeah, that might be...

**Adam Argyle:** But I think Shopify...

**Una Kravets:** You know, that's a good idea. What do you think of Spotify?

**Adam Argyle:** That was also on my list... And the other one on my list here is Vercel, because they're so hot right now. Everybody's probably gonna wanna work there; and if compensation's good...

**Una Kravets:** But I wouldn't call that a big tech company... So this is hard. This is hard, because you only get one answer... I know a lot of great people that went to Shopify.

**Adam Argyle:** I only know a couple that went to Spotify...

**Una Kravets:** ...but I can't say that they're doing better now than they were a year ago. I mean, nobody is... \[laughter\] Not the people, the company. Spotify has those sweet, sweet, benefits, just like Netflix. I think that people are thinking about the benefits with the Netflix answer, too.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah. Shopify was all stock, right? Because they're like the eCommerce backbone.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we're running out of time here. You're gonna have to confer and pick one of these.

**Una Kravets:** Alright, Adam, you pick.

**Adam Argyle:** \[00:18:05.17\] I'm gonna say Shopify based on the stats of who went where... I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. For the steal and 61 additional points to add to your score - is Shopify number four? \[fail alert\] It is not... So we will award the 61 points to the Keyframers...

**Shaw:** It's gonna be none... \[laughter\]

**David Khourshid:** Actually, I wrote "myself" on my thing; I should have remembered that.

**Jerod Santo:** And I will say that you guys did not learn from last round... Of course, 12 people said "None." Should have seen that one coming, but it's difficult. So three people said Amazon, three people said Vercel, three said Spotify, three said Netflix, two said Cloudflare, one said Adobe, presumably after they heard about Katy Perry's mushroom-filled fantasy land... And one said "Anyone that lets me write Ruby", and then one said "The one with the least crazy CEO."

**Shaw:** Ooh, burn...

**Jerod Santo:** So there's a few runners-up...

**Shaw:** I feel like there's one audience member that's really set on Ruby on Rails...

**Jerod Santo:** I think so... \[laughs\]

**Adam Argyle:** For real, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** All the Ruby answers are coming in by one person. Alright, so after two rounds, it's a tight game... CSS Podcast with 80, Keyframers with 61, and we move now to round three.

**Break:** \[00:19:23.29\]

**Jerod Santo:** Now, this round is a little bit different. We call this the Inverted Round. So we're just gonna take turns, team by team, guessing responses, but the points at the bottom of the board are higher than the points at the top. So while you're trying to match the board, you're actually trying to match the least popular answer to get more points.

The question that we asked our listeners - "How many monitors do you use while coding?" There are four responses on the board, and I will say the least popular response is worth the most points. So David and Shaw played the last round, let's let Una and Adam start this round; we're just gonna go back and forth... And let's start with Una. Go ahead and guess what you think people said when we asked them how many monitors they use while coding.

**Una Kravets:** Okay, so this is how many monitors they use, but the least popular answer.

**Jerod Santo:** That's what you wanna get. They're all worth points, so you can get the top score and get points, but you're gonna get more points by getting the bottom score.

**Una Kravets:** Well, I know how many I use, so... \[laughs\] I think what I wanna go with is 3. Like, if they have two monitors and a laptop, that's gonna hurt your neck. But I know people do it. So my answer is 3.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, show us 3. \[win alert\] Three is on the board, and it is in slot number 3. 14 people use three monitors, which means you get 15 points for that response. I'll award those now, and now we'll go back to Keyframers, and let's go to Shaw. How many monitors do people use while coding?

**Shaw:** Let's see... If we're going with least popular, I'm gonna say one is on there, but it's not gonna be the top one.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us one... \[win alert\] Yes, one is on there, and it's the number two response, so you get slightly less points. You still score ten. 35 people out of 100 use one monitor. We'll award those points now, and go back to CSS Podcast.

**Una Kravets:** I'm team one. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** And we'll go to Adam. So one monitor is taken, three monitors is taken. Those are the two and three slots. The one and the four are still available; of course, the four is worth more than the one. What do you think?

**Adam Argyle:** I'm gonna go with the pattern we've seen... People are gonna say "None", they're gonna reject it. "I don't." So people say "I don't", or "None."

**David Khourshid:** No monitor coding... That's impressive.

**Adam Argyle:** Just their laptop.

**David Khourshid:** I'm not using a monitor right now, so that's valid.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, I'm assuming people are gonna think of this as external monitors, because it's impossible to -- I guess it's not impossible to code without a monitor, but... People are gonna say "None. Just whatever is built-in", or whatever. So that's my answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Bold. Very bold. Did anybody say they code with no monitors? \[win alert\] They sure did. One person - I made an exception to the rule - said "Zero monitors", and they said "I am fully blind, and I do everything by touch." So they don't use a monitor because they can't see.

**Adam Argyle:** Wonderful.

**Una Kravets:** Very cool.

**Jerod Santo:** So you get 20 points for that. Congratulations. And there's the number one answer still out there. So we'll award those, and we'll go back to Keyframers, and we'll go to David for the last one out there. I think you can probably infer what it is.

**David Khourshid:** Two.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, the number one answer --

**David Khourshid:** Sixteen monitors... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Two monitors. 50, literally half of the people are using two monitors when they code. That's worth five points, and we'll award those... And thus ends our inverted round. Good job Adam on -- I didn't think anybody was gonna get the zero on this one, because it's so obscure... But there we go. Alright, let's head to round four.

Okay, so at the beginning of round four we have Keyframers with 76, CSS Podcast with 115; it's anybody's game. There's two more regular rounds, and then the last round is double points. So if you're behind, you have a big chance of coming back in round six.

We asked 100 JS Party listeners to finish this sentence: "I couldn't code without..." What? Without \*blank\*. We'll now have an interface-off. We're back to David and Una facing off. So Una went first the first time, and we'll have David go first this time. David, there are six answers on the board. What couldn't people code without? I will say, on this round and a few others, the responses vary, but kind of mean the same thing, so we're grouping the categories. So if you hit a very specific thing that's in a category, I'll let you know, and we won't count it as a guess.

**David Khourshid:** \[00:25:53.23\] Okay. Well, I know that I can't code without coffee. I turn coffee into code, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, show us coffee. \[win alert\] It's on the board. Where is it on the board? It's at number four, with eleven responses. So Una does have a chance to match higher than that. What is something else that people can't code without?

**Una Kravets:** Continuing on the alliteration, I can't code without a computer.

**Jerod Santo:** Without a computer. Taking a very literally --

**David Khourshid:** The math checks out... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Did our audience take it as literally as that? \[win alert\] They sure did. Number one answer was "hardware", whether it was a keyboard -- people said "keyboard", they said "computer", they said "electricity", or "internet".

**Una Kravets:** I was thinking electricity also...

**Jerod Santo:** We grouped all those together, and that's 23 people. So CSS Podcast, you are playing this round. Adam, we go to you. There's still four slots open. What else can people not code without?

**Adam Argyle:** Nice, we've crossed \[unintelligible 00:26:48.10\] Does second monitor -- is that in hardware? I kind of assume it would be...

**Jerod Santo:** Second monitor - yeah. Any sort of hardware is in there. Even no monitor is in there, I suppose.

**Adam Argyle:** Knowing some of your listeners, I'm gonna say TypeScript.

**Una Kravets:** Ooh...

**Jerod Santo:** Show us TypeScript. \[fail alert\] I'm happy to announce that that is incorrect.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, I'm actually in the same boat. I don't need TypeScript, but I thought everyone else did. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You've been overwhelmed -- yes, you've been influenced by Nick Nisi. He's strong on the message, but no. We are out there still in force, us regular JavaScript authors. Alright, but that's a strike, so we go back to Una. Now you've got one strike against you.

**Una Kravets:** Alright, I'm still on this literal train... I can't code without a text editor of some sort.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us text editor. \[win alert\] Yeah, number two answer, 22 responses. Some said "editor", some said specific editors, like Vim, VS Code etc. We've put them all in one group... And that was number two. So we're back to Adam. One strike, you've got half the board cleared, but there's still half up there. What do you think?

**Adam Argyle:** It's getting tricky...

**Una Kravets:** You got this, Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** I'd say "hands", but... Is that hardware? \[laughter\] And I know people can code without their hands, right? You're just like "Nah, I don't need hands to code. I'll code with my voice." Code in VR with your elbows, or something; I don't know. I am gonna say "hands." Fingers and hands.

**Jerod Santo:** That's not grouped into hardware. I think that's kind of wetware, or I don't know what kind of ware that is... But is it on there? \[win alert\] Yes, it is!

**Una Kravets:** Oh, nice!

**Adam Argyle:** Oh, I got lucky! Oh, man... I thought for sure I was going down...

**Jerod Santo:** And it's in the general category of body parts. So this includes brains, hands, eyeballs, and other such things that you can't code without... Or at least some people cannot. Alright, so that's still one strike; back to Una. We've got two things left, three and six.

**Una Kravets:** Alright, I'm thinking like people would probably something like Stack Overflow, or like a way to help them get answers... So I'm gonna say Stack Overflow. I don't know if that's been grouped into a larger section...

**Jerod Santo:** Is Stack Overflow one of the things that people cannot code without? \[win alert\] Yes, it is. And it's grouped into the generic thing of Google. Stack Overflow, GitHub... Web resources.

**Una Kravets:** Yeah, helpers.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. 14 people. So the board is almost cleared. You've got five of six. The last one is still on there... 76 points awarded so far, and one strike. You've got two guesses at number six. Back to Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** Okay, there's some silly ones on here, but I feel like another silly one is sitting there at number six... I could go really heady, you know, like "purpose", but I don't think your audience people were like "I can only code with purpose..."

**Jerod Santo:** What are you trying to say about our audience? They don't have purpose? \[laughter\]

**Adam Argyle:** I'm a user-centric engineer, so for me, I'd be like "I can't code unless there's a user, because otherwise I'm just coding into the ether", but again, heady... I don't think anyone else is gonna say that... It's a very Adam thing to say...

**Una Kravets:** You could be your own user...

**Adam Argyle:** \[00:29:47.08\] I could be my own user... I'm gonna go with the only other thing on my list that maybe makes sense, which is funding. Money. You have to give me stuff to do this. I'm not gonna do this for free, ish...

**Una Kravets:** That's a good answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Compensation maybe? Show us compensation. \[fail alert\] Sorry, not on there, compensation...

**Una Kravets:** I thought it was a good try.

**Jerod Santo:** It was a good guess... But you know, some of us just code for the love... Two strikes.

**Una Kravets:** That's true.

**Jerod Santo:** Una, back to you.

**David Khourshid:** I lose money when I code... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** That happens as well, yeah.

**Una Kravets:** Time is money. \[laughs\] I don't think I have a better answer, but the place my mind went was like "What are your physical needs when you're doing any task?" and sleep is one of them. So maybe I can't code if I'm sleep-deprived; I need my sleep.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm... Show us sleep. \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, sleep is not on the list... But this provides opportunity to the Keyframers to get back in the game here... Lots of points to steal. We turn to you; you can discuss. It's number six, so not very many people said it... In fact, five said it... But what do you think they said? What was that last response? Go ahead and discuss.

**David Khourshid:** Shaw, one recent trend that's been all over Twitter and the internets has been AI and ChatGPT, and I know that personally, I rely on it a good bunch to do coding. So...

**Shaw:** Yeah, I think that's good... I don't know that the audience will be fully on that train...

**David Khourshid:** Don't underestimate them.

**Shaw:** So none is a possibility here. "I couldn't code without none."

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] That's always a possibility... "I reject your premise, sir."

**Shaw:** There's at least one response that's Ruby on Rails... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, for sure.

**David Khourshid:** That's true...

**Shaw:** But a more realistic answer is probably like source control, like Git, that kind of thing... Or open source, like Npm, and...

**Jerod Santo:** So we've got AI on one hand, and open source...

**Shaw:** Where do you think our audience is going?

**David Khourshid:** I feel like when asked this question -- I don't know, I'm still stuck on the ChatGPT thing. Or, sorry, Copilot. That's what I meant.

**Shaw:** Alright, let's go with it.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, quick meta game here - what if one of you is right and the other one's wrong? How are we gonna feel that we go with one and not the other? Is this gonna tear up the Keyframers?

**Shaw:** Just half the points...

**Jerod Santo:** Could this be the end of the Keyframers as we know it? The behind-the-band, years from now...? Like, what happened was this answer on Frontend Feud. Well, let's see what it is here. You said GitHub Copilot/AI helpers. Did our audience say that? \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, but they did not.

**David Khourshid:** Oh, man. I'm so sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** But in order to keep the band together, I'll say Shaw was also wrong... And the correct answer - well, let's award these points here to CSS Pod...

**Shaw:** The Terminal...

**Jerod Santo:** And the correct answer was "Peace, and quiet, and muting all the things..."

**David Khourshid:** Space. They needed space.

**Jerod Santo:** So Una was in the ballpark with her physical needs. Just, sleep was a little bit outside of what they were saying. Now, there were other responses --

**Una Kravets:** I guess you have peace when you're sleeping. Come on. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** You still got the points... \[laughs\]

**Una Kravets:** Just kidding. I thought that source control was a very good answer.

**Jerod Santo:** I did too, as well. Tooling, in general, you would think... Although editor is kind of on the fringe of that, but... One person said patience and stubbornness, which I thought was funny, because we asked for one thing... One person said "Wasting 50% of my time on meetings", and so they were pretty sour... And then talk about literal - "The one thing I can't code without are the letters C, O, D and E." So that was a snarky response, I thought.

**David Khourshid:** Okay. Wow.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Thanks, guys... Alright, so thus ends round four...

**Una Kravets:** I'm surprised no one said programming languages.

**Jerod Santo:** And there was no Ruby on Rails. So while it was a good guess, they probably got sick of answering that particular thing. After four rounds, we've got CSS Podcast pulling away a little bit; it's still in play, but it's 191 to 76. Let's move to round five.

\[00:34:00.16\] Alright -- oh, and it turns out... I forgot this, but round five is also inverted. So this will be just like round three, where we go back and forth. You're trying to match the bottom of the board, and the phrase they're matching against is "My primary web browser is \_\_\_\_\_\_." Let's start with the Keyframers this time. David.

**David Khourshid:** Alright, the hot new one is Arc. I feel like there's a couple of people who've answered that...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Shaw:** It is a great browser.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Arc. \[win alert\] You are correct, sir, and it's near the bottom of the list, number four. So you're awarded 20 points for that.

**David Khourshid:** Yes...!

**Jerod Santo:** Very nice answer. Now we go over to CSS Pod, Una.

**Una Kravets:** I'm just gonna say Chrome.

**Jerod Santo:** She's taking the easy points. Is Chrome on there? Of course it is... And it is number one. \[win alert\] So you get five points. Back to Keyframers, and Shaw...

**Una Kravets:** Oh, I didn't realize this was an inverted one. My bad. That was my fault... I thought it was normal, and then I -- yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Hey, five points is five points.

**Shaw:** I'm gonna go with Safari. I think that's probably towards the bottom...

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Safari. \[win alert\] Yes, it is the worst answer, which makes it the best answer! Six people, 25 points.

**Shaw:** Yes...!

**Jerod Santo:** I'll award those to you. The plot thickens... Adam, we're over to you. Two and three are still on the board.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, Firefox.

**Jerod Santo:** Firefox is on here... \[win alert\] Number two, ten points awarded to you. And Keyframers - can they swipe up -- what's the word? Swoop up? Sweep up! That's the word. Can they sweep up these last 15 points? David's turn.

**Shaw:** What's in the middle...?

**David Khourshid:** I mean, I have two good answers, and one of them is silly, one of them is more realistic... But considering the audience, I'm gonna say people gave the joke answer of Internet Explorer.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a very interesting guess. Is it on there? \[fail alert\]

**David Khourshid:** No...

**Jerod Santo:** They took this one seriously. You had the exact wrong time to go jokey. Una.

**Una Kravets:** Oh, Microsoft Edge. The other one from Microsoft.

**Jerod Santo:** Microsoft Edge. \[fail alert\] Not on the list. Back to Keyframers with Shaw.

**David Khourshid:** Come on, Shaw...!

**Shaw:** Man, the only other one on my list right now is Brave. Given the tech audience, that seems to be a go-to... Is it on there?

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Brave. \[win alert\]

**Shaw:** Strong.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, it is. You've found it, that number three. 16 people using Brave, worth 15 points... And that concludes round five. Hey, it's a tight game. We have Keyframers with 146, CSS Podcast with 206. There were a couple other answers... So four people said Edge. Two with Vivaldi...

**Una Kravets:** That's less than Safari. I should have won more points. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, but it didn't make the top. It didn't have the requisite five...

**Shaw:** It's tricky...

**Jerod Santo:** And there's one lonely Opera user. Hi, Opera user...

**David Khourshid:** Aww...

**Break:** \[00:37:07.23\]

**Jerod Santo:** We now go to our final round, and this one has twice as many points on the board.

**Una Kravets:** I love that music.

**Jerod Santo:** Thank you. Round six, the final round - double score. We'll go back to our interface-off. This time it'll be Shaw versus Adam, and please remind me who went first the first time, so I can be fair. Was it you, Shaw?

**Shaw:** I think it was me.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Does that sound right?

**Adam Argyle:** I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** It was oh so long ago. \[laughter\] Well, let's just assume you're correct, and go with Adam. So the question, "What one word sums up why you make software?" And I'll say this is another one where we end up grouping some words together, that meant very similar things... But there are six answers on the board. It's anybody's game. Probably whoever wins this round wins this edition of Frontend Feud. So no pressure, Adam, but you're up.

**Adam Argyle:** Thank you for that no-pressure warning.

**Jerod Santo:** You're welcome.

**Adam Argyle:** Okay, I'm just gonna say for the love... Maybe it's in the middle, I don't know. Love. Passion.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us love. \[fail alert\]

**Adam Argyle:** Dang.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm sorry.

**Adam Argyle:** I'm alone in that, apparently.

**Una Kravets:** That hurts. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** No love. There's no love on this board. Shaw, that means it's wide open for you to take the round...

**Shaw:** Yeah, the opposite of love - money. I'm gonna say it's on there.

**Jerod Santo:** Well played. Show us money. \[win alert\] Yeah, that one's on there, and it is in slot number two. 15 people responded, which is worth 30 points, and you now take the board. So Keyframers will play this round. Number two is taken. One, three, four, five and six are still out there. David, what do you think?

**David Khourshid:** For fun. Enjoyment. Pleasure. Fun.

**Jerod Santo:** Fun, enjoyment, pleasure, but notably not love...

**David Khourshid:** No, no.

**Jerod Santo:** Is fun on there? \[win alert\] Number one answer.

**David Khourshid:** Yes!

**Jerod Santo:** Joy, fun, enjoyment. Very good. Okay, one and two are gone. Shaw, back to you.

**Shaw:** To solve a problem, fulfill a need.

**Jerod Santo:** Your second phrase kind of ruined it for me... Do I give it to them anyways? It's close... Ah, I'll give it to you. \[win alert\] Number three was puzzles, challenges, and problem-solving. To fill a need was maybe moving beyond the whole challenge of it, but I'll give it to you.

**Shaw:** No, you need to solve a problem. It makes sense.

**Jerod Santo:** Fair enough, fair enough.

**Shaw:** Well, like, I need some piece of software to do X, Y, Z, so I write it myself.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. See, that's further away. These people are thinking like the puzzle aspect; like, the challenge. But you got problem-solving, that's literally in the list, so I gave it to you. You're good to go. One, two, three, and you have four through six on the board. No strikes yet. David, you're up.

**David Khourshid:** I know a lot of people -- like, besides it being a job, a lot of people just like automating stuff. So I would say for automation.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us automation. \[fail alert\] There were a couple that agreed with you, but not enough to make the board. So there's your first strike... It's getting pressure-filled at this point. You need three more to take the game. So, Shaw.

**Shaw:** \[00:41:53.04\] Ah, geez... So it's one word; that makes things tricky... To help? Like helping others? That's two words, but...

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, but help is not on there. Now we're down to two strikes. We have one more guess, three on the board, so your back's up against it... But you can still do this. David, what do you think?

**David Khourshid:** Okay, so some probably make software, you could do it for a job, you could do it for money, as a puzzle... I make software to -- you know what, this is sort of a silly answer, but for fame. People want to be known.

**Jerod Santo:** Hmm... For the fame. Do JS Party listeners want the fame? Let's see it. \[fail alert\] I'm sorry, but they did not say fame.

**David Khourshid:** I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** Pretty good guess... We have the steal available to you guys over there at the CSS Pod to retain your championship. You've got three opportunities to drill it. What are you thinking?

**Una Kravets:** Oh, this is hard.

**Adam Argyle:** I'm so glad they said a few that were on my list...

**Una Kravets:** Yeah, me too.

**Adam Argyle:** David, you and I were on the same page, and I was like "Oh, they're gonna win!" and then I was like "Oh, s--"

**Jerod Santo:** I expected more people to say automation, for sure.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, automation was definitely on mine. So on mine I have "Tell a story", and I have "lols." Just for the lols. Because I'm trying to think of what silly stuff people put in this.

**Una Kravets:** I think that's the first one, the joy/fun.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I would group that under joy.

**Adam Argyle:** So that just leaves me "Telling a story", and... Yeah, I don't know; this is a tough one. Because you've got -- yeah, ends meet, making money, you've got job security... So it's like -- that one kind of wraps up family security, or whatever; like, "I write software because it's like a stable tech job." Or maybe that's it, it's stable. Software is perceptively stable...? I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** What do you think, Una?

**Una Kravets:** Are we allowed to talk on this one?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. This is a steal.

**Una Kravets:** Oh. I wasn't sure. Okay, I have some thoughts... I mean, my first thought is like, you know, the money, the benefits...

**Adam Argyle:** Get rich.

**Una Kravets:** ...that's probably included in the job, all those reasons. I also think the impact of making software, reaching people, kind of making a difference... The way that you can work on something that a lot of people use - it feels like there's purpose to it.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, I'm wondering if that's in problem-solving. I was thinking the same thing, and I didn't know if --

**Una Kravets:** But I don't think it is, because of the way Jerod responded to that answer... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Are you trying to read my eyes? \[laughter\] I'm over here -- I'm on Reddit, so I don't know what you guys are talking about.

**Una Kravets:** I think that the logic aspect of it is like the challenge, but the impact aspect of it is like why do you do that.

**Adam Argyle:** Impact is a good one.

**Una Kravets:** Alright. Should we go with that?

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah.

**Una Kravets:** Impact, making a difference?

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so set the stage, we have Keyframers with 136, CSS Podcast with 206... These points are theirs unless you can steal it. You have three opportunities on the board; you guessed impact. We already have joy, money, puzzles... What else could be possibly on there? Is impact on the board? \[win alert\] Yes, it is!

**Adam Argyle:** Nice!

**Una Kravets:** Yay!

**Jerod Santo:** It's grouped into "Satisfaction, accomplishment and impact." Six people said that; that's 12 points. That's a steal, that's all the points... And once again, the CSS Podcast defend this time their championship. You are the winner once again. Congratulations!

**Adam Argyle:** That made an impact, Una. Well done! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Let's clear the rest of this board, just for the lols... Number four was creativity...

**Adam Argyle:** Oh, nice. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** ...or craft, or hobby. They do it as a hobby. Sometimes you're like "Isn't that fun?" Yeah, but they said the word hobby, not the word fun... So trying to keep them in separate categories there.

Number five, curiosity and interest. Again, somewhat related to problem-solving and challenges, but they were using these words, so we let them stand on their own two feet. A couple other - four people said love, Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** Alright... It's cool...

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:46:01.02\] So you were close. Two people said passion, which maybe you could put in with love and make a category, but I didn't... Two people love the magic...

**Una Kravets:** That all feels like it goes together...

**Jerod Santo:** One said laziness...

**Una Kravets:** Magic, love, passion...

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah. Laziness and automation...

**Jerod Santo:** And of course, stubbornness is back; our stubbornness answer reoccurs... So that rounds out our game. So at the end of six rounds, CSS Podcast - 312. Keyframers - you guys played a heck of a game; it came down to it at the very end, but at the end of the day, CSS Pod, champs once again. Congrats!

**Shaw:** Good job.

**Una Kravets:** Good job, Shaw and David. You killed it.

**David Khourshid:** Thank you... We won't be bitter.

**Una Kravets:** I still like your source control answer. \[laughter\]

**David Khourshid:** Thank you. This audience just needs to get on board.

**Adam Argyle:** They do, they really do. Especially the Ruby guy.

**Jerod Santo:** The Ruby guy. Come on, Ruby guy...

**Una Kravets:** Well, I couldn't remember any runtimes at the beginning of this... I was just stuck.

**David Khourshid:** Yeah, that was tough. It was tough.

**Jerod Santo:** So at the end of the Super Bowl they interview the winning team and they ask them very heartfelt questions, and so I will do that now with Una and Adam. Adam, you've put your heart out there today, you had some silly answers, you had some sarcastic ones that really hit... I feel like you really reverberated with our audience, if that's even the right word, which it's not... What was your emotion when you realized that this final answer was correct? What did you feel out there?

**Adam Argyle:** Thanks, Jerod. When I came into that final question - you know, I was listening to Una, I was listening to all the options, and I really just had to internalize... \[sipping noise 00:47:23.15\] That's me sipping Gatorade.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Argyle:** But you know what - as soon as she said "impact", I knew it, I felt it to my core. It was just so obvious, and so we went with that. And now we won! Oh, yeahhh!! Aaahh!! \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** I love Adam's Super Bowl voice. Oh, he left the screen... He's out of frame... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** He's gone. He's going to Disneyland, yeah. Una... You know, at the end there we thought we had maybe a fumble, you didn't realize you could even talk... And so Adam's over there, you left him on an island, no communication... He's fumbling and bumbling, he's saying things that don't make any sense... And then out of nowhere, at the very end, you swoop in and you bring your logic and reasoning... What motivated you to swoop in at the end there?

**Una Kravets:** Well, I've gotta say, it's a team effort; I wanted to make sure my teammate had a platform, was able to get out what's on his mind... And honestly, I was a little silly in that moment. But here we are... All that matters is we made it in the end. We made it in the end, my friend. We ended up on top! \[laughter\]

**David Khourshid:** \[unintelligible 00:48:14.12\]

**Una Kravets:** I'm on a chair, I can't run. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Very good. Well, I would ask you what you're gonna do with the winnings, but of course, there aren't any, because this is a silly game show...

**Una Kravets:** We're going to Disneyland!!

**Jerod Santo:** ...made by silly people, on a silly podcast...

**Una Kravets:** Oh, we're not going to Disneyland...?

**Jerod Santo:** You can go to Disneyland if you like... It's just gonna cost you quite a bit, I believe, as it's a hot place to travel these days. Well, Keyframer guys - thanks so much for playing. David and Shaw, it was a valiant effort. We really appreciate that. Of course, CSS Podcast, you're invited back to defend your championship the next time, as we asked 30 questions on this survey, and we only used six. So we have a lot left in the barrel so to speak, and we don't have to nag our listeners to play some more games... So that's very cool.

Of course, one of our listeners will be drawn at random for that free JS Party T-shirt, one of the people that took the survey, so stay tuned for that. We'll probably announce it in our Slack, and I'll also just email you if you're the winner. If you're not the winner and you want some of that sweet, sweet swag, merch.changelog.com, of course. Go get yourself a T-shirt.

But yeah, this has been Frontend Feud, another awesome battle. I've been Jerod, this is JS Party, and thanks, y'all. We'll talk to you y'all next time.

**Adam Argyle:** Boop, boop-boop-booop-boop-boop, boop, boop-boop-booop-boop-boop... Boop. \[laughter\]
