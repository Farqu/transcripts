**Jerod Santo:** Hello, and welcome back, friends, to Frontend Feud. I am Jerod, and I am ready to host an excellent game. We have two spectacular teams. We have the returning champs, Shoptalk Show. What's up, guys?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Hey, hey, hey!

**Dave Rupert:** Heeeey, glad to be here!

**Chris Coyier:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna be awesome!

**Jerod Santo:** Of course, Dave and Chris joined by our very own Amelia, back with Shoptalk, ready to defend that championship.

**Dave Rupert:** We have the carry. I feel real good about today. To all the Shoptalk maniacs out there, we're doing this for you! \[laughter\]

**Chris Coyier:** \[00:03:55.21\] We're basically the Ken Jennings of feuding about web technology.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go. Well played. Notice what we did not hear is team Syntax, the losers; no offense, Syntax, but... \[laughter\] Not invited back. In their place, the contender this week are friends from the CSS Podcast, Una and Adam. What's up?!

**Una Kravets:** Woooooah!

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah!!

**Una Kravets:** We're stoked, yeah. We're gonna give them a run for their money. \[We're gonna take you out in the second round\] \[laughs\]

**Adam Argyle:** I'd like to know that they're paid to know about CSS... \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** As opposed to having a CSS blog site...

**Chris Coyier:** I am fully intimidated, so... Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, professionals versus amateurs over here.

**Una Kravets:** I don't know what I'm doing here... We've got these defending champs, we've gotta at least give them a good fight.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, adjoining your team is our very own Nick Nisi, who may or may not have won this game last time he played... He can't remember, but he was there.

**Nick Nisi:** I can't remember...

**Jerod Santo:** We think he was there. And he's here now.

**Nick Nisi:** Hoy-hoy.

**Una Kravets:** Cannot confirm, nor deny.

**Adam Argyle:** Welcome, Nick. We're gonna kick some butt.

**Jerod Santo:** So this is the game of responding to the question not with necessarily the correct answer, but the most popular answer. So we have surveyed JS Party listeners, and we have six rounds of statements which they've answered in a text field. They can write in anything they want, and so they have done just that, and we have normalized and scrubbed those suckers up, put them into groups, and you all are going to try to match the most popular answers on the board.

So we've split into two teams, there will be a face-off, an interface-off, if you will, each round, where one member of each team "steps forward" and has a chance to guess first. The person during the face-off that matches the highest response, their team wins that board, and they then play that round.

When you play the round, you have to try to match every single answer on the board. You have three deaths that you can die... Actually, two, because if you die the third death, then you're done... At which point the other team has the chance to steal.

When you steal, you can confer with your team. You can all decide on what you're gonna guess for the steal. When you're not stealing, you cannot confer. So you're on your own to make a guess.

After six rounds, the team with the most points wins. Any questions?

**Una Kravets:** \[00:06:18.21\] Is there a buzzer? Can we buzz in?

**Jerod Santo:** There will not be a buzzer. We will take turns instead, just because real-time issues... And so even when we do the face-off, we will let one team guess first, and then the other team guess second, and we'll just rotate teams each round, so it's fair.

**Una Kravets:** Oh... I was really looking forward to racing somebody for \*buzz!!\*

**Jerod Santo:** You can still buzz. You can buzz all you want. It just won't affect the endgame. \[laughter\]

**Chris Coyier:** Una, it's Cmd+Q, actually, is the buzzer.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh...! \[laughter\] You know it's Cmd+Q actually, it's the buzzer... \[laughter\]

**Chris Coyier:** Yeah, that's the buzzer, yeah. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Nice... Nice. Okay, so we are ready to play. We'll begin round one. Round one will be Dave versus Una. Step right up.

**Una Kravets:** Buzz!

**Jerod Santo:** She's still, so she did not fall for the Cmd+Q...

**Chris Coyier:** She buzzed in, she has to answer.

**Una Kravets:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** We will pull up the game board, everybody can see that...

**Una Kravets:** Oh, this is fancy.

**Chris Coyier:** Whow!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Wow!

**Chris Coyier:** You had a budget increase for that... \[laughter\]

**Adam Argyle:** This is great.

**Jerod Santo:** This is professional here. So we'll start with Dave, since they're defending champs. There are six answers on the board. The question is "Name your favorite programming language that is not HTML, CSS or JS." You're trying to match that number one answer, if possible. Dave, what do you think?

**Dave Rupert:** I'm gonna go with the cool kid Rust.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Rust. \[win alert\] Number three answer, with 19 responses. So you're on the board, but Una now has the chance to match higher. If she can pick number one or number two, then the CSS Podcast plays round one. Una, what do you think?

**Una Kravets:** Okay, so this is a favorite programming language, and I'm gonna try to go with one that maybe more people are familiar with in the web community...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Una Kravets:** I'm gonna try Java.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, show us Java. \[fail alert\] I'm sorry...

**Dave Rupert:** I thought you had it...

**Jerod Santo:** Good guess, good guess. Unfortunately, Java did not make the top six. The threshold, by the way, for being on the board is you must have at least five responses. So certainly there were people that said Java, just not five or more. Okay.

**Una Kravets:** I mean, Java made me cry, but some people like it...

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah, it said "favorite", so Java definitely not...

**Una Kravets:** That's true, that's true.

**Jerod Santo:** "Favorite" is a tall order, isn't it?

**Una Kravets:** I was thinking popular.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so Shoptalk wins the board, that means Shoptalk gets to play this round. Dave started, so now we will go to Chris... Name your favorite programming language that is not HTML, CSS or JS.

**Chris Coyier:** Python.

**Dave Rupert:** Good answer, good answer, good answer...!

**Una Kravets:** That was my second one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, did Python make the board? \[win alert\] And where does it land? Ohh, number one answer!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Nice...!

**Una Kravets:** Oh, I should've gone with that...!

**Jerod Santo:** 33 responses. So you guys are off to a great start. Slots one and three and taken; two, four, five and six are still on the board, and we go to Amelia.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Gosh, Python's such a good one...

**Chris Coyier:** That's right; it's like the data analysts' favorite, right?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I feel like this is gonna fall into the same slot as Java, but I'm gonna go with C++.

**Dave Rupert:** Good answer, good answer...!

**Jerod Santo:** Show us C++... \[fail alert\] Sorry, that did not make the board.

**Dave Rupert:** Good try, good try, good try...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, you have one strike against you... You've died one death, and now it's Dave's turn.

**Dave Rupert:** Okay. I've got a few to choose from, but I'm gonna bias this based on the Changelog audience, and say Go, because you have a Go podcast.

**Chris Coyier:** Way to steal my answer, Dave...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** That's a good one.

**Dave Rupert:** \[00:10:02.28\] Oh, sorry. I had other ones, I could give you that one...

**Jerod Santo:** A very targeted answer, at our targeted audience... Does it pay off? \[win alert\] Yes, it does.

**Dave Rupert:** Yes!

**Jerod Santo:** Go, number four answer. 11 people like Go.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Nice...!

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, we have slots two, five and six still available, and we're back at Chris.

**Chris Coyier:** Well, the trajectory leads us to Ruby here. Let me say Ruby.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, show us Ruby. \[fail alert\]

**Una Kravets:** What?!

**Jerod Santo:** Not so fast, my friend, not so fast...

**Chris Coyier:** What...?!

**Una Kravets:** That surprises me. I would have thought Ruby is on there.

**Jerod Santo:** That also surprises me. It definitely was answered, but not five people, so... It has been falling out of favor. That's two strikes...

**Chris Coyier:** I'm gonna go again.

**Jerod Santo:** Go back to Amelia.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Chris can go again. \[laughter\] Oh, man... I'm totally blanking here. I'm gonna go with something that I know people will say, but maybe not a lot of people... Don't kill me again, please. Lisp...

**Dave Rupert:** Ooh, okay...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** It's not a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Not a good one...

**Dave Rupert:** There's gonna be some nerds...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. The question is how many nerds are there? Are there five nerds? \[fail alert\] No...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Not enough nerds.

**Jerod Santo:** There are not five nerds.

**Dave Rupert:** I'm curious, are syntaxes -- anyway...

**Jerod Santo:** So we have the number one answer, Python, the number three answer, Rust, the number four answer, Go, and there's three more still on the board. So team CSS Podcast, all you have to do is match any of those to steal all of these points. So you can confer amongst your team, discuss what you think is our listeners' favorite programming language that's not HTML, CSS or JS.

**Nick Nisi:** There's an obvious answer here...

**Una Kravets:** I have an idea...

**Adam Argyle:** It starts with the letter P?

**Nick Nisi:** It starts with a T, and it has an S in there...

**Adam Argyle:** Okay, so yeah, is TS gonna be available? It's like JavaScript...

**Nick Nisi:** It's semantically different, and people argue over that, so I guarantee it's up there.

**Adam Argyle:** I'm sure it's listed... Yeah, I think it's in there, too.

**Chris Coyier:** That's not fair...!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I'm not happy about this...

**Una Kravets:** I also was wondering about Node, because that's also JavaScript.

**Chris Coyier:** Also not fair...!

**Jerod Santo:** Ooh...

**Una Kravets:** Yeah, I don't know...

**Adam Argyle:** So PHP, TypeScript...

**Jerod Santo:** Remember that it just depends on what they answer. There's no rules for what you can answer. Whatever they answer, that's what's in there.

**Chris Coyier:** Well, that's true...

**Adam Argyle:** I'm curious if SQL is in there...

**Una Kravets:** Interesting. I also am curious if there's like mobile developers that listen to the podcast. Maybe like Swift.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, Swift or Kotlin are on my list.

**Una Kravets:** I feel like TypeScript is pretty popular, but I just don't know if that's far enough from JavaScript. This question is a little uncertain...

**Nick Nisi:** Given the audience, I think it is.

**Adam Argyle:** TS is a safe bet. What about Sass? So no CSS; if we're allowing TypeScript, do we allow Sass?

**Una Kravets:** I think it's the same thing though, like Sass is to CSS, TypeScript to JavaScript...

**Jerod Santo:** I would agree in principle they're the same... We're gonna need a final steal answer. What do you all think? What are you going with here?

**Una Kravets:** Should we just go with TypeScript?

**Dave Rupert:** I think LESS. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** TypeScript is your final answer?

**Una Kravets:** Let's do it. Let's lock it in.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Did our listeners love TypeScript? \[win alert\]

**Dave Rupert:** Oh...! Pizzas!

**Adam Argyle:** It's number two.

**Jerod Santo:** Number two answer, with 20.

**Una Kravets:** Nice...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** That's not fair...

**Chris Coyier:** It's good to remember there's no rules. You could answer Jurassic Park, right?

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. But you have to get at least four other people to also answer Jurassic Park for it to matter.

**Chris Coyier:** Yeah.

**Chris Coyier:** Okay, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** So we will give those points to team CSS Podcast. They scored 83 on round one. Oh, shoot. I did it wrong; let me try that again. Hit this button instead. Yes, much better. And we'll also reveal number five, which was C\#.

**Adam Argyle:** Wow.

**Jerod Santo:** Nine people.

**Chris Coyier:** So close with C++.

**Jerod Santo:** Number six, which is blasphemy -- I mean, PHP... I'm just kidding, I have enjoyed PHP...

**Chris Coyier:** Yeah, of course. I had PHP on my list, but...

**Jerod Santo:** A couple of honorable mentions - two people mentioned SQL, so there you go, Adam... And one person said "That's the only other language I know." One person said "I don't know any other languages." One person said CoffeeScript, which was just...

**Adam Argyle:** \[00:14:01.15\] Yeahh-- I mean, what? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** And one person said jQuery, which... Yeah, a little bit out there... But one person loves jQuery.

**Chris Coyier:** 52 people said Spanish... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, that takes us to round two, so next we will have Chris and Adam facing off. Step right up, guys. Round two. Adam gets to guess first, because this is the second round, and the Shoptalk team guessed first the first round. Name someone who helps many people learn HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript. Top five answers on the board. Adam, who helps other people learn these things?

**Dave Rupert:** Who is Jen Simmons?

**Chris Coyier:** Good answer, good answer...

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Jen Simmons. \[fail alert\] I am sorry, Jen did not make the top five. Okay, Chris, you're up.

**Chris Coyier:** The audience is your podcast. I could say your name, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** That would only apply if I actually taught them anything, which is not the case.

**Chris Coyier:** Kevin Powell. We'll how popular Mr. Kevin has gotten.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Show us Kevin Powell.

**Chris Coyier:** Have you seen his subs lately? It's crazy.

**Jerod Santo:** I have not. \[fail alert\] Okay, so - first time I think this has ever happened. Nobody matched in the first... So we go back to Adam and we just do it again.

**Adam Argyle:** Who is Web Bos?

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Wes Bos. \[win alert\] Number one answer, Wes Bos. 49 of our participants. That's a lot of people, so congrats to Wes. He's been helping lots of folks.

**Una Kravets:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** And Chris now has a chance to steal -- oh no, you don't. That's the number one answer, so Adam wins the board. I was like, "Hold on a second..." And team CSS Podcast gets to play round two. So we have Wes Bos at the top, we have a couple who are not on the list, and now Nick Nisi, who do you think people said helped them learn these technologies?

**Nick Nisi:** Hm... I'm gonna go the other half, I'm gonna go Scott Tolinski.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Scott Tolinski. \[fail alert\] Sorry, Scott...

**Chris Coyier:** Poor Scott, look at that...

**Jerod Santo:** Scott made the honorable mentions.

**Una Kravets:** This question is gonna... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** We turn out to Una.

**Una Kravets:** Alright, so I feel like because the audience is the JS Party podcast, it's gonna be leaning on people who have helped folks learn JavaScript.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Una Kravets:** I'm gonna go with you, Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** You're gonna go with me. Okay, let's see, do people learn things from me? \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** Your podcast.

**Jerod Santo:** \[win alert\]

**Dave Rupert:** Yes...!

**Una Kravets:** Nice!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Nice!

**Una Kravets:** Oh, JS Party, number three.

**Jerod Santo:** This was a lumping in -- some people said me, some people said JS Party, some people said Nick. So I just combined all this together and said "Yes, JS Party is on the list." It makes sense, it's our podcast and it's our audience answering the questions, so good job, Una, for identifying JS Party as someone who helps other people learn.

Adam, back to you. You have one strike, and you have three answers left, slots two, four and five.

**Adam Argyle:** Dan Abramov.

**Jerod Santo:** Dan Abramov. Fine answer, fine answer. Was it on the board? \[fail alert\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** What...?!

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, wow...

**Dave Rupert:** I'm kind of glad, because otherwise this would have just been "Who is cool in React?" \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Right...

**Una Kravets:** It still might be...

**Dave Rupert:** It still might be, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** I will say that both Dan and Scott Tolinski were mentioned multiple times, but not at the threshold level. Okay, so two strikes... Nick, you're back up again.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright...

**Jerod Santo:** And you have to hit this one or you're done.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, man... Okay.

**Una Kravets:** You've got this, Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** You know, I'm gonna go Chris Coyier.

**Una Kravets:** Yeah.

**Adam Argyle:** It's a good one.

**Chris Coyier:** You took my answer, man...

**Jerod Santo:** You're just kissing up.

**Chris Coyier:** Totally stole my thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Do people learn things from Chris Coyier? \[win alert\] They sure do. Number two answer, Chris Coyier, with 13 people.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** That should count for our team.

**Chris Coyier:** Look at the fall from Wes though... Come on, man...

**Jerod Santo:** I know, Wes is dominant. \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** So we've got to keep going, team. What have you got?!

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:18:04.27\] Yup, keep going. So we're back to Una. You have to get that number four and five slot. There's two left on the board, and you have one strike left.

**Una Kravets:** Alright, I'm gonna go with someone who I've definitely learned a lot from... Sarah Drasner.

**Dave Rupert:** Ooh, clutch.

**Chris Coyier:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Good answer. Show us Sarah. \[fail alert\] Unfortunately she did not make the list. Alright, we have now an opportunity to steal. Currently, team CSS Podcast has 69 points in this round...

**Chris Coyier:** Nice...

**Jerod Santo:** But y'all can confer and you can steal those points, plus what's left on the board; there's slots four and five. You have two answers that will match. What do y'all think?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** My only other one is maybe Josh Comeau, who has been killing it recently.

**Chris Coyier:** Oh yeah, he's huge. That's a good one. Or you go old-school with like Zeldman, or Eric Meyer, Rachel Andrew, you know...

**Dave Rupert:** Kent C. Dodds...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Oh, that's a good one.

**Dave Rupert:** Addy Osmani...

**Chris Coyier:** Yeah.

**Dave Rupert:** Gosh, this is hard.

**Chris Coyier:** Can I open my RSS reader?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I like Kent. I feel like everyone knows Kent.

**Dave Rupert:** I feel like -- I don't know, maybe he's up there just from a React testing... I mean, who else are you gonna learn it from?

**Chris Coyier:** I'm totally down with that one, about the Josh idea, too.

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah. Your pick, Amelia.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I think Kent has a pretty large name at this point.

**Dave Rupert:** Let's lock it.

**Chris Coyier:** Let's do it. Kent. C. Dodds! Let's hear that ding, hear that ding.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. I need to make a confession. So I know that Kent was on the list, but I do not have him in my list. So I must have missed him in the final answers. He was right there, he was in the list, but he's not on the list. So I'm gonna give you guys another guess, because he's not actually on the board. Somehow he got lost in translation.

**Dave Rupert:** Was that a data entry error?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, it was a data entry error. Or we can pause and I can go look it up and refresh my board and we can do that.

**Dave Rupert:** No, that's alright...

**Jerod Santo:** Jerod here. I looked it up and Kent did have 11 responses. So he would have been in third place. Sorry about that, Kent. Alright, back to the show.

Guess another one. We'll give you one more guess.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** This is rigged. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, now I feel terrible.

**Dave Rupert:** I mean, Josh might be \[unintelligible 00:20:12.11\]

**Chris Coyier:** Let's just do it.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I like Josh.

**Jerod Santo:** Aww.... \[fail alert\] Well, I thought it was a good answer. \[laughter\]

**Chris Coyier:** I thought he was leading us to pick that...

**Jerod Santo:** The steal fails. I'll have to go back to my notes and see where Kent fell into the line.

**Chris Coyier:** So we missed the steal.

**Jerod Santo:** So CSS Pod picks up those 69; we're gonna add those there. Let's look at the final two answers.

**Una Kravets:** Wow.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** It doesn't look good.

**Jerod Santo:** Someone who helps many people. FreeCodeCamp/Quincy Larson. Six votes.

**Adam Argyle:** We're heading for a \[unintelligible 00:20:44.28\] here?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, it's a text field, so whatever they type in... And the last one, number five, Brad Traversy, the popular YouTuber.

**Chris Coyier:** Doesn't matter... Jurassic Park... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Five responses. Okay, so... CSS Podcast dominant thus far, with 152 points after round two.

**Una Kravets:** It's all luck.

**Jerod Santo:** But don't worry, there's more rounds to play. We head to round three, and we face off Amelia versus Nick. Step right up.

**Break:** \[00:21:19.15\] to \[00:22:26.00\]

**Jerod Santo:** The question for this round - which emoji do you use most often in commit messages? \[laughter\] We're back to team Shoptalk.

**Una Kravets:** That's a great question.

**Dave Rupert:** I love this.

**Jerod Santo:** And we have - Amelia gets to guess first. What do you think our listeners responded with on this, Amelia?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** That's a really tough one. They're all tough.

**Jerod Santo:** I will say, on this one I did some groupings. So if you don't hit it exact, but you're in the same ballpark, we will also match. Because there's a lot of variations.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I can't tell if people went with jokey ones, or serious ones, but I'm gonna go with grimace... Because I use that very often.

**Chris Coyier:** That was my first thought.

**Dave Rupert:** That's a good one. Good one.

**Una Kravets:** We're gonna learn a lot about each other on this one.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me grimace. \[fail alert\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** What?! Not even on the list? \[laughs\]

**Chris Coyier:** Is that the teeth one, with the --

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Yeah, yeah.

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, yikes.

**Una Kravets:** That one looks like a smile to me.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** It's the best emoji.

**Chris Coyier:** I used the today already. It's early.

**Jerod Santo:** Clearly, our listeners are more optimistic than our panel here... Nick, what do you think people said when we asked them "Which emoji do you use most often in your commit messages?"

**Nick Nisi:** Hm... You said you were grouping them, so I'm gonna go "The one with the yellow face." \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I'm sorry, but we're not grouping them --

**Una Kravets:** Good answer, good answer...!

**Jerod Santo:** Zoom in... \[laughter\] Enhance...

**Nick Nisi:** I'm going to go with "None."

**Jerod Santo:** Ooh... Show us "None." \[win alert\] Number one answer!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** What?!

**Una Kravets:** Outside the box!

**Dave Rupert:** Whoooow!

**Una Kravets:** Who are these people...?!

**Jerod Santo:** I know, right?

**Nick Nisi:** Professionals, that's who.

**Chris Coyier:** That's not how my brain works...

**Jerod Santo:** Professionals... In fact, one person said "I don't use emoji commit messages, you heathens." \[laughter\] So they were not just saying "None", they were mad about it.

**Dave Rupert:** \[00:24:10.23\] 42 people were like "I reject the premise of this entire question." \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** Which is almost half.

**Jerod Santo:** This is true.

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, they're like "What kind of tacos do you like?" and they're like "Waffles." \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, "I would never eat a taco."

**Nick Nisi:** I was gonna say one, but I kept hearing Chris say Jurassic Park right in my ear, so...

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, that is just the Jurassic Park of answers. This is great. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, with that, Nick takes the board for team CSS Podcast...

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, way to go, Nick.

**Jerod Santo:** ...another move of dominance. And we go to Una. Now, there's still six more on the board. There are seven total answers, so lots to pick from here. What do you think, Una?

**Una Kravets:** Alright, I frequently will use the ta-da emoji, or like the one with the confetti coming out of a little red thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Alright, show us ta-da.

**Una Kravets:** The Hurray. Ta-da!

**Jerod Santo:** \[win alert\] That's grouped into the celebrations emoji, which is the ta-da, the celebrate face, the...

**Chris Coyier:** Party horn?

**Dave Rupert:** Those were all of my guesses right there. \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** This second one was my second guess.

**Jerod Santo:** The raised hands, and then that one with like the confetti opening up out of the two pinecones, or what are those things...? Shells? I don't know.

**Dave Rupert:** It's a Japanese ornament that opens.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Good job, very nice. So now number one and number six are taken. We go to Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** Nice. So the celebrations are definitely -- you know, after your 20th commit, trying to get your GitHub Action to finally do the thing, you're like \[unintelligible 00:25:28.29\] It works!"

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] "It works! Finally!"

**Adam Argyle:** I'm gonna go with -- well, I've got a few here... I'm picking fire.

**Una Kravets:** Hm, that's a good answer.

**Nick Nisi:** It's a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us fire. \[fail alert\]

**Dave Rupert:** Oh...!

**Chris Coyier:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** I thought that was a good answer as well. No fire.

**Chris Coyier:** People are too -- there's nobody that confident.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, back to Nick. You have one strike.

**Nick Nisi:** Okay, I'm going to go with the green square with the white check in it.

**Una Kravets:** That's a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** I use that one all the time. Do our listeners also use it? \[fail alert\] No, they do not.

**Una Kravets:** What...?!

**Dave Rupert:** What?!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** There are no other emoji.

**Dave Rupert:** Good luck, everybody...

**Jerod Santo:** I will say, I'm looking at the answers and you're missing some pretty obvious ones. No offense. But we're back to Una.

**Chris Coyier:** Really?!

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Una Kravets:** Okay, I'm gonna go with the poop emoji.

**Chris Coyier:** It's gotta be on the list.

**Jerod Santo:** Please, show me poop. I never thought I'd say that on a podcast... \[laughter\] \[win alert\] Yes. Poop, number three answer, with nine responses. Alright, so you're hanging in there... Back to Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** Alright... I've got two that I think are good runner-ups. I'm going to go with cry.

**Una Kravets:** \[laughs\] That's a good one.

**Adam Argyle:** Simple tear, double tears, you know...

**Jerod Santo:** Show us cry. \[fail alert\]

**Dave Rupert:** Ohhh...!

**Jerod Santo:** I guess there's just so many emoji to pick from, it's tough to actually narrow down. Okay, so you have 58 points, but now team Shoptalk can steal. They have lots of opportunities. There's still four responses.

**Chris Coyier:** Okay, we can talk about this, right?

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Match any and you guys steal these points.

**Chris Coyier:** Isn't there that Git convention? People even put Git hooks in there that say "You cannot. You have to" it has to say "Fix colon" or it has to say "Design colon", or whatever.

**Jerod Santo:** Conventional commits, right? Isn't that what it's called?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Mm-hm.

**Dave Rupert:** Conventional commit? I see a lot of like lipstick, or nail polish... Like, "I'm just making this pretty."

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I like the nail polish.

**Chris Coyier:** Or the wrench, when the tool -- for fixes, \[unintelligible 00:27:30.21\]

**Dave Rupert:** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**Chris Coyier:** But I don't know...

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, there's a whole thing for that, isn't there? Like, emoji commits, or whatever.

**Chris Coyier:** Nail polish is good for design, you know...

**Dave Rupert:** Nail polish is the only one I could think--

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I feel like that covers all of it. I can't think of anything else other than cry-laugh... But my guesses haven't been going well...

**Jerod Santo:** Ha-haa... Okay, so what's the consensus then? Nail polish?

**Chris Coyier:** Yeah, nail polish.

**Dave Rupert:** Nail polish.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Nail polish.

**Chris Coyier:** It's gonna be great. Number two answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, show us for the steal "Nail polish." \[fail alert\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** What?!

**Dave Rupert:** No way...!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** What are these answers?!

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:28:08.11\] This was a tough round.

**Dave Rupert:** Aliens answered this one.

**Jerod Santo:** Tough round. Alright, do you guys wanna know -- let's score these...

**Chris Coyier:** Still hanging out at zero points...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. CSS Pod -- you're gonna have to use that double-round to really come back, because right now they are...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Smokin' us.

**Jerod Santo:** ...at 210 to 0.

**Dave Rupert:** Woof.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's look at the answers that were still on the board... Smiles. People like the smiles, guys.

**Chris Coyier:** Just the classic. We should have gone classic, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, classic smiles. How about shrugs?

**Adam Argyle:** Thumbs up was in here...

**Jerod Santo:** The shrugs is pretty --

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Shrug is a good one.

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, that's a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** Ship it, rocket... The rocket...

**Dave Rupert:** Ship it...!

**Jerod Santo:** Ship that sucker...

**Una Kravets:** I was thinking the ship as another...

**Jerod Santo:** And then the classic, age-old thumbs up. \[unintelligible 00:28:46.06\]

**Una Kravets:** Oh...

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, the thumbs up, yeah.

**Chris Coyier:** I feel bad about myself...

**Jerod Santo:** So... Rough round. This is going tough. This is not Shoptalk's day... \[laughter\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Sorry, team...

**Una Kravets:** This is a real hard one, don't feel bad.

**Dave Rupert:** Hey, we'll get a point, everybody. Don't worry. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** We are only halfway through the game. There's three more rounds, so anything can happen. I mean, you win the next three rounds...

**Una Kravets:** Beginner's luck.

**Dave Rupert:** Rocket is just wrong. You don't put the rocket in the commit message, because you don't know yet. Your CI hasn't passed yet. You put the rocket after the CI passes, as a comment.

**Chris Coyier:** That's a comment.

**Dave Rupert:** That's a comment.

**Jerod Santo:** That is a good follow-up.

**Dave Rupert:** I think people didn't read the question.

**Una Kravets:** Well, most people didn't like emojis in commit messages.

**Jerod Santo:** That's true. 42 were like "Seriously, guys. Take the emojis out of your commit messages."

**Chris Coyier:** 42 people are major bummers. \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** Like, where's hearts?

**Adam Argyle:** Major bummers.

**Dave Rupert:** No fun at work...

**Jerod Santo:** This was one that had a lot of one points. A lot of people had this one thing as their favorites... But okay, let's move to the next round. This is the inverted round. This round works a little bit differently. There's no face-off, it's just back and forth between the two teams. You're trying to match the board, but actually the lower answers score more points. So you do not want the most popular answers, you want the bottom of the board.

So there are six answers on the board, and the statement that we had them respond to was "Name a website that's frequented by software developers." So we will start with Shoptalk, and we'll start with Dave. "Name a website frequented by software developers."

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, I mean... The goal is not to get the number one answer. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Unless you want some points.

**Dave Rupert:** I think it'll be middle of the pack... I think Dev.to.

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, that's good. Because it's not gonna be like the top answer, but it's up there.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, show us Dev.to. \[fail alert\]

**Dave Rupert:** That means it's low though... That's good... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you got the spirit of it right. You got the spirit of it right.

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, good for me.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we go back now to CSS Podcast. Una, your turn.

**Una Kravets:** Okay, a website frequented by software developers, but it should be the top one.

**Chris Coyier:** But not too much.

**Jerod Santo:** I will mention that the top one also scores you points, it's just not as many points. So like if you're sitting at zero, you might go for it, I don't know...

**Una Kravets:** Okay...

**Jerod Santo:** But you're sitting at 210, so whatever you like.

**Una Kravets:** Well, Dev.to wasn't on there, so that's interesting... What about something outside the box, like Medium? That has some articles for developers...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Show us Medium. \[fail alert\]

**Una Kravets:** Too low.

**Jerod Santo:** I think there was one person that said Medium, so you're not totally off...

**Dave Rupert:** Get us a point, Chris... \[laughs\]

**Chris Coyier:** Is it back to me?

**Jerod Santo:** Now it's to Chris.

**Chris Coyier:** I'm just going to pick something safe. We'll just say Stack Overflow. It's gonna be on \[unintelligible 00:31:33.19\]

**Una Kravets:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Stack Overflow. \[win alert\] Number one answer...

**Dave Rupert:** Perfect.

**Jerod Santo:** 65 respondents, which gives you five points... But hey, you've got five points.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** We've got five points!

**Chris Coyier:** Do we just immediately get them? No, we have to steal --

**Jerod Santo:** Yup, I've just added those right now, so you've got them right there. Now we go to Adam. Your turn.

**Adam Argyle:** Alright, I'm going to choose Twitter.

**Dave Rupert:** Out of the box, Jurassic Park pick. \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** \[00:32:01.14\] Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Do developers hang out on Twitter?

**Una Kravets:** That's a good one, honestly.

**Jerod Santo:** \[win alert\] And I will say it is the bottom answer...

**Dave Rupert:** Oh, dang it, Adam!

**Una Kravets:** Yes, Adam! A-dam! A-dam!

**Jerod Santo:** You score 30 points for your team. Very well played. We go back to Shoptalk and Amelia.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I think middle of the board is gonna be like MDN.

**Dave Rupert:** Good answer, good answer, good answer...

**Jerod Santo:** Show us MDN. \[win alert\]

**Dave Rupert:** Wow!

**Jerod Santo:** Number two answer, worth ten points. 22 people said it. You get ten points for that. It's a good answer. And we go to Nick, back with CSS Podcast.

**Nick Nisi:** What is less popular than MDN, but more frequently visited than Twitter... W3Schools.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us W3Schools. \[fail alert\] I think one troll said W3Schools. In addition to yourself, Nick.

**Chris Coyier:** What about w3.org though...?

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, back to Shoptalk and back to Dave.

**Dave Rupert:** I'm gonna say GitHub.

**Una Kravets:** You stole my answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you think that developers go ot GitHub? Yes, they do. \[win alert\] Number three answer.

**Dave Rupert:** See, we'll do the top of the cake, and then...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Going down the list.

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** 12 answers. It gets you 15 points. I'll award those to you. Go back here, and we go to Una. There's now two slots open. Slots four and five. So to review - number one, Stack Overflow. Number two, MDN. Number three, GitHub. Blank, blank. Number six, Twitter. What have you got?

**Una Kravets:** Oh, man... I was thinking the Gits, but now I've gotta go alternative paths. So so far none of these really are blogs. We've got documentation, we've got question asking, we've got doing productive work, we've got learning things... Is there a blog on here? There probably is. Okay, what is a big JavaScript blog though? I'm just gonna go with what's on top of my head; what about Smashing Magazine?

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Smashing Magazine. \[fail alert\]

**Una Kravets:** I wasn't sure...

**Jerod Santo:** Not quite there. Okay, Chris...

**Chris Coyier:** I was kind of thinking Patreon.com/shoptalk... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Throw you a bone after this...?

**Dave Rupert:** That'll get you access to the Discord, and everyone knows that's a really great place to be, in the D-D-D-Discord, so...

**Chris Coyier:** We'll take a google shout-out at web.dev.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us web.dev. \[fail alert\] That was in the honorable mentions, but didn't quite make the top six. So now to Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** What is YouTube?

**Una Kravets:** Oh, YouTube. That's a good one.

**Dave Rupert:** Whooow! Jurassic Park answer.

**Jerod Santo:** What is YouTube? \[fail alert\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** It's a tough one.

**Jerod Santo:** Not a website.

**Una Kravets:** That's surprising.

**Dave Rupert:** Discerning developers use Vimeo. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** In retrospect, one of these will be very obvious, though one will be slightly less so. Amelia?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I don't know what to do with that hint... \[laughter\] It doesn't make me feel good about it.

**Jerod Santo:** What websites do software developers frequent?

**Amelia Wattenberger:** I was gonna say CSS-Tricks, because I use it very often.

**Dave Rupert:** Good answer, good answer...

**Chris Coyier:** Good answer! Hell yeah!

**Jerod Santo:** Still? \[fail alert\]

**Dave Rupert:** Weak! Wrong! \[laughter\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Incorrect...

**Jerod Santo:** CSS-Tricks was an honorable mention. Alright, back to Nick...

**Nick Nisi:** Wow. Can I specify specifically the Flexbox on CSS-Tricks? \[laughter\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** You can!

**Jerod Santo:** Number one answer?

**Nick Nisi:** I think I'm out of ideas here. Are there other websites?

**Dave Rupert:** There's no more websites, no...

**Jerod Santo:** There's a few left.

**Nick Nisi:** One is very obvious...

**Jerod Santo:** There's at least two websites left out there.

**Chris Coyier:** It's pretty much just that Space Jam one...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Can I go again...?

**Jerod Santo:** Space Jam... \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** It's Space Jam and Alibaba. I think those are kind of the last ones...

**Nick Nisi:** Let's see... There is one that's very obvious... I'm going to say Npm.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm... Do JS Party listeners frequent Npm? \[fail alert\]

**Una Kravets:** That was a good answer though.

**Jerod Santo:** Good answer, good answer. Tough, tough to match what people are thinking. We're gonna go back over to Dave on Shoptalk.

**Dave Rupert:** \[00:36:07.27\] Oh, my gosh... Okay. We've got Stack Overflow, we've got MDN, we've got GitHub, and then people do other stuff, not YouTube, and then they do Twitter. I'm gonna just do like Amazon.com, I don't know... I don't know.

**Chris Coyier:** Something Amazon-related.

**Dave Rupert:** Let's see if the big ones, the big \[unintelligible 00:36:26.10\] This is my Jurassic Park answer.

**Jerod Santo:** So Amazon, final answer?

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail alert\] Okay... Una?

**Una Kravets:** Okay, I think I know it. I'm feeling good.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, okay, okay...

**Dave Rupert:** Bold!

**Una Kravets:** I believe that a website frequented by software developers is google.com.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you think people who are searching for things like answers to software questions might go to google.com?

**Una Kravets:** Just a hunch...

**Jerod Santo:** \[win alert\]

**Chris Coyier:** Dang it!

**Jerod Santo:** That's the obvious. Oh, shoot! Hey, Jerod here again... At this point I clicked the wrong thing. I thought it was Google, it was actually Hacker News, revealing that as a correct answer. I quickly clicked it again to flip it back over, but it was too late.

**Chris Coyier:** Ohh...!!

**Dave Rupert:** What?! \[laughter\]

**Chris Coyier:** I guess Hacker News... Is it Hacker News? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Hold on, hold on... Slow down... I've gotta give team CSS Podcast the points for Google. They get 25 points. And due to my slip-up and the whole Kent C. Dodds situation, I'm gonna award team Shoptalk 20 points for their excellent answer of Hacker News!

**Una Kravets:** \[laughs\]

**Chris Coyier:** Thank you...

**Una Kravets:** Good job, Chris!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** It feels good.

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, good job, Chris.

**Chris Coyier:** I was gonna go with Slack, so I would have got it wrong, you know?

**Nick Nisi:** We almost lost our 200-point lead.

**Jerod Santo:** A couple more honorable mentions were CSS-Tricks, as I said, Reddit, W3Schools and Slack were the other honorable mentions.

**Una Kravets:** Hm. Reddit, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, that brings us to the end of the inverted round. That's round four. There's two rounds left, and after four rounds the CSS Podcast leads with 265 points, Shoptalk now - hey, you're cooking. You've got 50, so you're on the board and you're ready to play round five. Here we go!

**Break:** \[00:38:20.17\] to \[00:38:29.10\]

**Jerod Santo:** We will have a face-off. I think we're back to Dave and Una facing off. We asked developers to name a place outside of your house where you like to code/work. There are six answers on the board. We'll start with Una this time.

**Una Kravets:** Alright, power of the space shirt, I'm gonna be channeling.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Una Kravets:** I like to code at coffee shops.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us coffee shops. \[win alert\] The number one answer.

**Chris Coyier:** Can't beat that!

**Jerod Santo:** So Dave does not get an opportunity. CSS Podcast plays the round. You have the number one, and there are five left. Alright, Adam.

**Adam Argyle:** This is really weirdly hard. I'm trying to -- oh, what's the popular name for these...? There's like a brand of them, they're work lofts where you can rent out a little space...

**Una Kravets:** Oh, like WeWork?

**Adam Argyle:** WeWork!

**Chris Coyier:** Table talk, table talk...

**Una Kravets:** Oh, sorry, I was trying to help with the description...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] She was trying to help. That's exactly what table talk is, is trying to help. \[laughs\]

**Una Kravets:** Sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** We'll let them have it though. The answer was WeWork?

**Adam Argyle:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail alert\]

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, would that be grouped in with co-working spaces generally? Probably...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Chris Coyier:** So that's not a thing.

**Jerod Santo:** It's not a popular one. Alright, Nick, that's one strike against you...

**Dave Rupert:** That's bad for the co-working industry... \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** Okay, a place outside of your house where you like to code/work... I'm gonna say work. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Excuse me?

**Adam Argyle:** Like, the office?

**Nick Nisi:** Like, your office.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, at your office. I thought you were just throwing the question back at me. "Where do I like to work? Work!" The office. Do people like to work at their offices? \[win alert\] Yes, they do. That is answer number three. I'm treading very slowly now on my flips...

**Una Kravets:** \[00:40:13.18\] Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** So the office had 21 responses. Good answer. So that's number three. One and three are gone, two, four five and six still remain. You have one strike against you, so we're back to Una, and you have two potential strikes before the steal.

**Una Kravets:** Okay, so I don't know if people actually like to code and work from this, but people like to take pictures of their laptops in front of it...

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Una Kravets:** People will post up at the pool and take a picture, but I don't believe they're actually working, because it gets too hot, and it's too bright. But I'm thinking like on -- I don't know how to word it for this, but on vacation, or at the pool, like a relax... How do I verb that? I'll just say the pool. At the pool.

**Jerod Santo:** At the pool, okay. Show us pool. \[fail alert\] Pool did not match, and I will say I included vacationing, or...

**Una Kravets:** I guess I'm on Instagram too much.

**Dave Rupert:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** People prefer to take pictures at the pool, of their laptops, versus working.

**Una Kravets:** Yes...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, two strikes, so you're now down to your final strike, and it's back to Adam.

**Una Kravets:** You got this!

**Adam Argyle:** No pressure... I'm not feeling any pressure... I say --

**Chris Coyier:** One wheel.

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, on your one-wheel. That's a really good answer, dang it. No, I'm gonna say the bar. Drinking beer, writing code, y'all.

**Jerod Santo:** Ooh...!

**Nick Nisi:** That was gonna be mine.

**Jerod Santo:** Do people like to code at the bar? \[win alert\] Yes, they do. Six points for that one. That's number five, so two, four and six remain.

**Chris Coyier:** \[unintelligible 00:41:39.01\] suck at drinking. I need to focus. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Get focused.

**Dave Rupert:** \[unintelligible 00:41:45.07\] get yourself to one task at a time.

**Nick Nisi:** I'm gonna say the park/outdoors.

**Una Kravets:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, show us the park. \[win alert\]

**Una Kravets:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** Number two answer. Park - that includes the garden, in a garden, or in my backyard, park, outdoors.

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, that's backyard, too?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. So now only two remain, slot four and slot six. You have 91 points racked up...

**Una Kravets:** Oh, this is hard.

**Jerod Santo:** ...and we're back to Una.

**Una Kravets:** Okay, let me think. Where would I -- oh, you know what? I have a good one... On an airplane. Like in transit.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us airplane.

**Una Kravets:** I think it's good, I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail alert\]

**Una Kravets:** Nobody else thought of this...

**Jerod Santo:** I liked it, I liked it... But less airplanes than previously, although we're starting to get on planes again... So that's it. You had three strikes and you're out. There's 91 points to be stolen. Shoptalk, this is your big opportunity to steal these points and get right back in the game.

**Dave Rupert:** This is horrible...

**Amelia Wattenberger:** We've got 'em.

**Jerod Santo:** There are two potential correct answers.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** So I was thinking library... Do people work from libraries?

**Chris Coyier:** That's pretty good...

**Dave Rupert:** Okay...

**Chris Coyier:** I have a gym in mind. If the bar's on there, it's like the opposite of the bar. \[laughter\] Not that you do it while you're working out, but then you get your --

**Amelia Wattenberger:** In between reps?

**Chris Coyier:** You get your smoothie when you're done, and post up at the little table, you know... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Too much Instagram...

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, I mean, those are -- library I think sounds good.

**Chris Coyier:** That's better, that's better...

**Dave Rupert:** I literally can't think where else -- I'm surprised park is on there, because you need Wi-Fi...

**Chris Coyier:** Or like a restaurant... I guess pub would be grouped into that.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I would lump restaurants in with bar and pub.

**Chris Coyier:** Mm-hm. I can't beat library. That's good. Of course that's where you go work.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** What else do people do outside their houses?

**Chris Coyier:** Or like "What do you do with your arms...?" \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** I mean, I'm in a backyard office/shed, so is that covered under backyard and office?

**Chris Coyier:** Probably...

**Jerod Santo:** Literally, both.

**Adam Argyle:** Oh yeah, that's totally covered. You should make that your answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, full coverage. \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** Um, boy...

**Jerod Santo:** What are we thinking here?

**Chris Coyier:** Or like school, or whatever? Is that generic enough to encompass library?

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah. Public facility... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** A public facility.

**Dave Rupert:** Publicly-funded facility.

**Chris Coyier:** Final answer. Like a library, for example.

**Jerod Santo:** We're gonna need an answer here. A lot does ride on this, I'm not gonna lie.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** We don't wanna mess this one up.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:44:28.14\] You don't wanna mess this one up.

**Dave Rupert:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** So you've got library, potential...

**Dave Rupert:** An amusement park made of dinosaurs. \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** Jurassic Park...?

**Jerod Santo:** We already did park, so that one's taken, actually.

**Chris Coyier:** I literally don't know.

**Dave Rupert:** Amusement park is covered under there?

**Jerod Santo:** Jurassic Park is covered under park/garden.

**Dave Rupert:** Alright, library. I think that's our only good one.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** That's all I've got.

**Chris Coyier:** Let's do it.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, for the big chance to steal 91 points, and stay in this game, show us library... \[win alert\]

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** Library indeed!

**Una Kravets:** Nice...

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, yeah!

**Adam Argyle:** Dang it, that was on my list.

**Jerod Santo:** So to review... At number one was coffee shop and cafés, at number two was park/gard/yards, at the office was number three, the library - number four answer. The bar and pub, number five answer, and you guys literally covered everything you could potentially think of, because the other one was nowhere/I don't leave my house.

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Oh, my God... \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** Come on, dudes...!

**Adam Argyle:** Similar to none, huh? Nice...

**Jerod Santo:** So I'm gonna take that one back off, hit Shoptalk, award the points...

**Dave Rupert:** Can we take points away from the people who answered that? Can they lose points?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] You're gonna have to find \[unintelligible 00:45:37.12\] and go take their points away.

**Dave Rupert:** Perfect.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, I will say, after round five it's very much a game again. So it got interesting. It was becoming to be a wipeout, but Shoptalk is back. And after five rounds, the CSS Podcast has 265 points, and the Shoptalk Show has 165 points. That may sound like a big gap, but the final round is double points, so there's plenty of opportunity for anybody to win this game.

**Una Kravets:** I'm sweatin'...

**Jerod Santo:** Let's move to the last round, the double round, round six, and we face off Chris versus Adam.

**Dave Rupert:** Oh, geez...

**Jerod Santo:** For the final round, what's the first thing you do when you think of a new project/idea? I believe it's Shoptalk's turn to go first. So there's six potential answers on the board, and you need to match the highest one to play the round. What do you think, Chris?

**Chris Coyier:** Oh, man... I'm not gonna give you answers though. I've got just think internally, in my own head.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Chris Coyier:** It makes for terrible radio...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, we'll edit this part out, the silence.

**Chris Coyier:** Buy a domain name...!

**Dave Rupert:** Yeah, yeah, good answer, good answer, good answer...!

**Amelia Wattenberger:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us "Buy a domain name." \[win alert\] And that is number four.

**Dave Rupert:** Really...?

**Jerod Santo:** 17 people said either "Name it" or "Buy a domain name". I grouped those two together, and that's worth 34 points. So that's what you will have to beat, Adam. You have to beat the number four answer to take the board.

**Adam Argyle:** New Git repo.

**Una Kravets:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** New Git repo. \[win alert\] Just inches it out at number three..

**Una Kravets:** Yeah...!

**Dave Rupert:** Wow, wow, wow...

**Jerod Santo:** So that includes anybody that said "Just get started", "Start writing code", "Start a new Git repo..." That whole thing that you do. Okay, so with that --

**Una Kravets:** Those two were my top answers, so...

**Jerod Santo:** The CSS Podcast is in control of the final round. Two answers are taken off the board, there's only four left. If you can answer all four of these, you de facto win the game. And we go to Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** I'm gonna say the easy think, "Talk about it, or tweet about it."

**Jerod Santo:** Show us "Talk about it." \[win alert\]

**Una Kravets:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** Number six answer. Ten people said "Tell someone", which was either talk about it, tell a friend, tweet about it, tell my spouse etc. Good job, Nick. We go to Una. Slots one, two and five are still out there to be taken.

**Una Kravets:** Okay. I'm gonna say "Sketch it out." Make a plan, sketch it out.

**Jerod Santo:** \[00:48:08.06\] Sketch it out. Do people sketch out their new project ideas? \[win alert\] Yes, they do. Number five answer - draw, whiteboard, or prototype.

**Nick Nisi:** Nice.

**Una Kravets:** Wow, number one and two...

**Jerod Santo:** You guys are really smokin' here... So one and two are the only two left...

**Dave Rupert:** Lookin' bad for all Shoptalk team there... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Unless they're running out of ideas. We'll see what happens. Adam, what else do people do when they think of a new project or idea.

**Adam Argyle:** I have a few good options, but I'm gonna go with prototype it. Quick prototype.

**Jerod Santo:** Prototype was inside the draw/whiteboard/prototype.

**Adam Argyle:** Oh, it is in there. Okay, then I'm gonna say npm init.

**Jerod Santo:** That one goes under "Just get started" kind of thing, which you already guessed.

**Dave Rupert:** How many guesses does it get? What's going on?! \[laughter\]

**Una Kravets:** They're all on the board.

**Dave Rupert:** Everyone gets infinity guesses, I guess... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[unintelligible 00:48:53.27\]

**Adam Argyle:** The database isn't letting me insert my value, so that means my turn isn't up yet, so I get to keep trying, right?

**Dave Rupert:** I mean, I think Jerod's way cooler than a database, but...

**Chris Coyier:** He's using the upsert model...

**Jerod Santo:** Database is my middle name. We need something here...

**Adam Argyle:** Dang... Okay, so yeah, these are just pretty abstract categories that a lot of mine are falling into... Like write a plan, write a document...

**Jerod Santo:** That's a tough one. Write a plan, write a document.

**Una Kravets:** Is that like whiteboarding it though...?

**Adam Argyle:** You know, words in a document, whether it's Notion, whether it's -- you've gotta take your notes, spell out your idea... Kind of put it in words out of your brain. Something where you're doing that.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I'm gonna give it to you.

**Una Kravets:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** Research, plan, brainstorm. So there's plan in there...

**Una Kravets:** Planning, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** These are tough ones to group, so I give it to you there. That's the number two answer, with 31 points.

**Adam Argyle:** Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** And the number answer is out there.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright, my turn?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright, I'm gonna say the obvious thing, which is "Nothing" or "Sit on it". \[laughter\]

**Dave Rupert:** Is that your third one where you --

**Jerod Santo:** Do they do nothing? \[fail alert\]

**Nick Nisi:** Aaaah...!

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, they do not do nothing. We all thought that was a good answer, but it's not.

**Dave Rupert:** Finally, the jackals coming through...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, good job, jackals... Okay, back to Una, and we now have two more strikes. The number one answer is out there...

**Una Kravets:** Okay, what do you do when you think of a new project/idea? So it's in your head, and Adam kind of said write it down, putting it on paper...

**Jerod Santo:** Plan was his -- he matched on plan.

**Una Kravets:** He landed on plan, so we've gotta -- we've gotta get it out. There's a few things that it could be, but I think a lot of them fall into these things. So much pressure... Okay, it's in your head...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Yes.

**Una Kravets:** Would design be like drawing it? It might be --

**Jerod Santo:** So between planning and drawing, I think design is taken in those.

**Una Kravets:** What's the first thing you do when you think of a new project or idea? Tell someone, put it on GitHub... Wow, this is hard. Would figuring out like a tech stack be a separate answer than these? Like, figuring out a gameplan...

**Jerod Santo:** If it's like "Pick your tech stack", I would take that as a separate. If it's like "Figure out a gameplan", that's more like planning it and brainstorming.

**Una Kravets:** Let's do "Pick your tech stack."

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, "Pick your tech stack." \[fail alert\]

**Adam Argyle:** Oh, that was a good guess. Everyone's like "Here's my idea, and here's the framework I'm gonna use." That's like the first thing out of their mouth, "I'm gonna use Framework X for my cool, new idea."

**Jerod Santo:** Right...

**Una Kravets:** Like, "I wanna build something with X."

**Adam Argyle:** Okay, I've got a final guess... This is a little more personal, I guess, because I have a lot of ideas, and when you have a lot of ideas, they tend to go in the backlog, so the first thing I do is I take this idea and I put it in the list of all the other ideas that I have.

**Una Kravets:** \[00:51:58.28\] Oh, that's a great answer, Adam.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us "Add it to the list." \[win alert\] Number one answer.

**Dave Rupert:** Wow...! Sweeped!

**Jerod Santo:** Wow! Well played, Adam, for the win!

**Chris Coyier:** 72 points...

**Una Kravets:** Write it down is there, too.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, that's the generalization, but it was more like "Write it down for later", versus "Put my thoughts on paper." It was more like "I'm gonna save it for later", which is kind of "Do nothing", which Nick said, but it's tough to group these things. I think the idea is "I'm gonna put it in my list of ideas so I don't forget it, but I'm not gonna work on it right now."

**Una Kravets:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** So... Wow, this was a great game. You guys swept the board. You kept Shoptalk off of the court for the final round. Congratulations, you guys. We're gonna award all 264 points of round six of your team. That's darn near what you had already, so doubling your score, with 529 points, our new Frontend Feud champions is Team CSS Podcast!

**Una Kravets:** Wooh-wooh! \[applause\]

**Chris Coyier:** All that research I did on color models... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** So, as a congratulations of winning Frontend Feud, you now have an opportunity, each one of you in turn, to give a shout-out to a website, to a project, to a person, to an idea - maybe one from your list, Adam - that you like. Anything you'd like to say to round out the show... Let's start with Una.

**Una Kravets:** Oh, gosh... Well, if you wanna follow me on Twitter, go to Twitter.com/una... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Twitter.com/una...

**Una Kravets:** And all the other stuff will be there.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Adam, anything to shout out?

**Adam Argyle:** Yeah, shot-out to one-wheels for killing my boredom.

**Jerod Santo:** What's one-wheels?

**Adam Argyle:** Wait, did you say "What's one-wheels?"

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Dave Rupert:** How much time have we got? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** For those of us not in the know.

**Adam Argyle:** Put it in maybe the hoverboard category in your brain, but it's the single wheel that you stand on sideways, and the wheel originally came from a go-kart, so it's a rubber tire with a board on it, that self balances, and you use it to go everywhere. It goes everywhere, it's very capable, surprisingly.

**Jerod Santo:** Very cool. I think I've seen these. I didn't know they were called one-wheels, but...

**Una Kravets:** Adam is a one-wheel advocate.

**Jerod Santo:** What do you advocate for? More usages of one-wheels? Less wheels, in general?

**Adam Argyle:** The freedom, and the feel -- they call it floating, because once you get comfortable, you really do feel like you're floating around the world, and it's awesome.

**Jerod Santo:** Very cool. Well, we'll add a link to some sort of one-wheels-based website in the show notes for people to check out. Nick! Congratulations, man, you were on the winning team, even though you're not on the winning podcast. You're on JS Party, still pretty good, I hear... Check out our Discord -- no, we don't have that. What do you wanna shout out? Do you wanna shout out our membership program, or...? TypeScript?

**Chris Coyier:** I recommend "Nothing", you know... \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** I think I was being pressured into that...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] TypeScript?!

**Nick Nisi:** You know, I'm going to shout out our lovely podcast that joined us today. I'm gonna say, if you want to talk shop, or learn about CSS, check out Shoptalk, or CSS.

**Adam Argyle:** Hey, thank you. That's nice.

**Una Kravets:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Very nice, very nice.

**Una Kravets:** Check out JS Party. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Dave Rupert:** Dot FM...

**Jerod Santo:** If you're listening to this and you haven't checked out JS Party yet, something went terribly wrong... \[laughter\] Or somebody's pirating our stream! Come on, people. Do your own thing.

Alright, well I just want to thank you all for joining us today. This game is always a blast. We had a lot of fun, it was a lively group, as expected... Y'all are awesome. Great game, it came down to the very end, and you know, the CSS Podcast pulled it out for the win. But that's our show... I also wanna thank Amelia and Nick for rounding out the teams and sprinkling in the JS Party goodness to the game.

So, for JS Party, I'm Jerod Santo, this has been Frontend Feud... We'll play again. CSS Podcast - y'all need to come back and defend your championship against some other group of podcasters to be decided later. Listener, if you have a favorite podcast that you want to get on Frontend Feud, holler at us at JSParty.fm and let us know. Advocate for the new contenders to the throne. For now, it's the CSS Podcast team holding it down.

Alright, y'all, thanks for watching. We'll talk to you again next time.
