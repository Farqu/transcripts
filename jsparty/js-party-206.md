**Jerod Santo:** Hello, and welcome to Frontend Feud. We are live at the React Advanced after-party. How are you all doing out there?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Lovely.

**Brandon Dail:** So good.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Really great.

**Colby Fayock:** Fantastic.

**Colby Fayock:** Super-good.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Excited!

**Jerod Santo:** We are excited as well. We've gathered together six amazing people to play Frontend Feud with us today. Let's get to know our contestants. So we have two teams. Team one is Tara, Nick and Colby. Let's start with Tara Manicsic. Nice to meet you, Tara. Thanks for joining us.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Very nice being here. I'm very excited... And it seems like I have the best team, so we're off to a great start. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Time will tell... Tara, to get to know you a little better, please tell everybody what is your favorite emoji.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Oh, it's definitely the grimace. I don't know what it's actually called...

**Yuraima Estevez:** Same.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** ...but I make that face constantly, and it's just like for every single thing that I awkwardly encounter. It's always the grimace face.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** So we do have the benefit of video with us today. Do you wanna give us a taste of what the grimace face looks like? \[laughter\]

**Colby Fayock:** Nailed it.

**Jerod Santo:** Awesome.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Perfect. Perfect.

**Jerod Santo:** Up next it's JS Party regular, Nick Nisi. What's up, Nick?

**Nick Nisi:** Hoy-hoy! Happy to be here.

**Jerod Santo:** Happy to have you as well. Nick, what is the strangest thing in your fridge?

**Nick Nisi:** Um, liquid aminos maybe right now... Which is a substitute for soy sauce. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... Never heard of it, so I guess it's strange...

**Michael Chan:** I hear ya. I'm with you on that one.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright.

**Brandon Dail:** It's good stuff, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Rounding out team one, it's Colby Fayock. Colby, would you rather be a fish or a bird?

**Colby Fayock:** I'd say probably a fish, so I can see all the cool stuff underneath the water.

**Jerod Santo:** Good answer, good answer. That's team one. Team two, starting off with Brandon Dail. Brandon, thanks for joining the show.

**Brandon Dail:** Thank you for having me.

**Jerod Santo:** \[04:13\] And Brandon, the people really wanna know - how many tabs do you have open.

**Brandon Dail:** Um, like in the window that I have opened right now, or the dozens of other windows that I have?

**Jerod Santo:** The aggregate. Aggregate them for us.

**Brandon Dail:** Okay. 50 probably.

**Jerod Santo:** 50. Not too bad.

**Brandon Dail:** Yeah, that seems pretty good.

**Jerod Santo:** We also have Yuraima Estevez. Hey, Yuraima, thanks for coming on the show.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Thanks for having me. I'm so excited to be here!

**Jerod Santo:** We're happy to have you. We'd like to know, would you prefer a bicycle, a tricycle, a unicycle, or just a plain old sickle?

**Yuraima Estevez:** I mean, I play a lot of Stardew Valley, so I think a plain sickle is for me.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Awesome choice. And last but surely not least on team two it's Michael Chan. What's up, Michael?

**Michael Chan:** What's up?! Good to see you.

**Jerod Santo:** Good to see you again. And - curious... What's your favorite text abbreviation?

**Michael Chan:** Text abbreviation?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you know, lgtm, iirc, brb, afk, wtf... The usual.

**Michael Chan:** You've just rattled off a bunch of them. Um, I mean, favorite's gotta be wtf, but I use omg a lot, too... So between those two, I'm pretty well covered.

**Jerod Santo:** Awesome. Well, that's our panel today. I'm Jerod Santo, I will be your host. We're playing frontend feud. This is a game all about matching the audience's preference. So we have surveyed 100 JavaScript developers, and asked them various questions about React, about JavaScript, about development, about life... And aggregated the survey responses. The two teams are gonna try to do the best job of matching the most popular responses from the JavaScript developers who were interviewed.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** What is the sample pool? Is it like -- are we thinking like React advanced already, so are we skewing towards React, or...?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. So we sent the survey specifically to the React advanced attendees, and then we branched out from there; we went from there to JS Party listeners, and then to the general Twitter people, and we've gotten a hundred great responses. So they're all gonna be either React advanced folk and/or JS Party listeners, and then Twitter followers from there. So that's your audience.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, each round starts with a face-off, or an interface-off, if you prefer puns...

**Nick Nisi:** Yes...

**Jerod Santo:** ...where one person from each team steps up and tries to guess the highest matched answer on the board. Whichever person gets the highest answer, their team wins that round and they get to play the rest of that board. You have three lives, so every time you guess a response that's not on the board, you lose a live. After three lives lost, the other team can then confer and have one chance to steal all the points that are on the board, and take that round.

At the end of the game, whoever has the most points wins, and the winning team gets absolutely nothing... No, just kidding. \[laughter\] The winning team gets a chance to shout out anything they would like to shout out on the show to our audience. So that's your --

**Yuraima Estevez:** Power. So any word? No, I'm just kidding. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, just shout any random word.

**Michael Chan:** You can then just yell at the end of the show.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, like "WTF!" would be a good one. So be thinking, if you win - maybe you have a favorite cause, maybe you have a developer you appreciate, maybe it's a cool project, maybe you've got some wares you wanna sell... Whatever it is, good chance to shout it out. But you've gotta win first. Any questions about the game?

Alright, let's play, shall we? We'll start round one, and the two contestants facing off are gonna be Tara and Brandon. Please step right up.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Here we go...

**Yuraima Estevez:** Here we go, here we go, here we go!

**Jerod Santo:** The first question we asked one hundred JavaScript developers is to name a common file extension found in React apps. Tara, you will guess first. If you get the number one answer, you win the board. If you get anything that's not number one, then Brandon will get a chance to guess.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Js.

**Jerod Santo:** Js.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Have you heard of that one? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[unintelligible 00:08:04.19\] Show me js. \[win sound\] The number three answer, with 13 responses...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** \[08:15\] Three?!

**Jerod Santo:** ...which means you did not get number one, and Brandon now has an opportunity to steal.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Oh, no...!

**Brandon Dail:** I'm gonna say jsx. Final answer.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Show us jsx. \[win sound\] But where does it fall? Oh, number one answer.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Ah...

**Jerod Santo:** So Brandon wins the interface-off, and team two takes the board. Team two, you will now rotate opportunities to guess. You cannot confer during this time, so you will be on your own to guess... And if you get the remaining two, then you get all the points. If not, three lives lost, and we'll chance to steal. So we now go to Yuraima. Please, give us an answer.

**Yuraima Estevez:** I'm gonna say tsx.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us tsx... \[win sound\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** Yeah!

**Jerod Santo:** Number two answer, with 34 responses. You're doing quite well. You have 1, 2 and 3 all knocked out, and there's only one answer left. We go to Michael... What's that number four response?

**Michael Chan:** Tsx -- I had that written down; that was the one I wanted to go with... So I guess I'm gonna go with .ts, round that out...

**Jerod Santo:** Let's see if it's on there... Show us .ts. \[win sound\]

**Michael Chan:** Oh, yes!

**Jerod Santo:** That is correct. Very good. So without missing a single beat, you all just guessed the top four responses to the question "Name a common file extension." I guess there's only so many extensions out there... We have .jsx, .tsx, .js and .ts.

**Nick Nisi:** There's no .mjs?

**Jerod Santo:** No... I'm sorry, Nick.

**Michael Chan:** Wait, can you put jsx in a .ts file? Is that even allowed?

**Jerod Santo:** It's a good question.

**Brandon Dail:** I don't think so. I think TypeScript gets mad, because there's some conflicting syntax...

**Nick Nisi:** But you probably have a lot of hooks.

**Michael Chan:** Yeah. True.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Michael Chan:** True. True. Fair.

**Jerod Santo:** So we award 92 points to team two. Award those points; very good. And we now move on to the next round, which is going to be Nick versus Yuraima. Step right up.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** We surveyed 100 JavaScript developers and we said "What is your favorite static site generator?" Now, team one went first last round, so we'll go to team two. Yuraima, you get to guess first - what is your favorite static site generator? There are five responses on the board.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Okay. I like to think I speak for the people, and my favorite static site generator is Next.js, the static side of it.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Yuraima Estevez:** The static side of it.

**Jerod Santo:** The static half. There you go. That works.

**Colby Fayock:** Does the answer have a little star on there? \[laughter\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** Yeah. A little asterisk on there.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's see if it's on the board. Show us Next.js. \[win sound\] Number two answer, with 23 responses, so pretty good, but not at the top. So Nick, you do have a chance to take the board. What do you think people answered, their favorite static site generator?

**Nick Nisi:** You know, I am hoping that it's number one, but let's go with number Eleventy.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me Eleventy... \[win sound\] Number three.

**Michael Chan:** Ooh. What's number one...?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I know! I know.

**Jerod Santo:** So you've got a correct answer, but you're actually lower, so team two once again gets to play this round. So we now go to Michael to name a static site generator.

**Michael Chan:** Okay. Well, I was gonna guess Eleventy, because I love Eleventy, and I was just gonna guess it, because I like it... But I'm gonna go the opposite direction and guess Gatsby...

**Yuraima Estevez:** \[12:01\] How is that opposite? What are you trying to say? \[laughter\]

**Michael Chan:** Oh, I mean... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Let's see if that opposite direction paid off. Show us Gatsby... \[win sound\] It sure did. And it's the number one answer, with 33 responses.

**Michael Chan:** Yes!

**Jerod Santo:** So of the five responses on the board, we have numbers one through three taken, Gatsby.js with 33, Next.js with 23, Eleventy with 11. There's still two answers on the board, and now we go to Brandon.

**Brandon Dail:** Those are all the ones that I know. This is tough.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** It gets harder from here, doesn't it?

**Brandon Dail:** Is Hugo one? Am I thinking if the right thing?

**Yuraima Estevez:** Yeah.

**Brandon Dail:** If that is one of them, then that's my guess.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, show us Hugo. \[fail sound\] Oooh...

**Brandon Dail:** First wrong answer.

**Jerod Santo:** First wrong answer.

**Michael Chan:** I liked the preface on that, "If that is one, that's my guess." \[laughter\]

**Brandon Dail:** It was a conditional one.

**Jerod Santo:** So we now lost one life, and we're back at Yuraima.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oh, man, I also don't really know... I'm gonna go default. Plain old HTML, I guess.

**Michael Chan:** So human static site generator. I like that. \[laughter\]

**Colby Fayock:** Pioneer.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, the old trick question. "My favorite generator is no generator." I guess "Show me no generator..." \[win sound\] What?!

**Michael Chan:** What?!

**Yuraima Estevez:** No way...!

**Jerod Santo:** Seven people.

**Michael Chan:** Wow. Well played.

**Jerod Santo:** Well played. Seven people said "None" or "Handwritten", or "Plain old HTML."

**Yuraima Estevez:** Bravo!

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Wow...

**Michael Chan:** Amazing.

**Jerod Santo:** Anybody out there just rocking HTML for their content sites?

**Michael Chan:** It's not even number five. That's incredible.

**Jerod Santo:** Nope, number four. We still have one more out there. You have two lives left; you've lost one life... Or have you lost two lives? Remind me. Brandon missed. Did Michael miss?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Just one.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, just Brandon. So you have two lives left, and we're on Michael.

**Michael Chan:** Oh, gosh... Okay. I just have to go with -- I don't know, I'm kind of confused at this point; I'm just gonna go with where the hype is right now, and I'm gonna say Astro. There's gotta be at least 2-3 people that said Astro.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Astro. \[fail sound\]

**Michael Chan:** Aww... Sorry, team.

**Jerod Santo:** I will say you're partially correct, because two people did say Astro, but you have to get five or more to make the board. So it was stated, but it's not on the board. There is something with five, we just have to find it. You have one guess left, and we are back to Brandon.

**Brandon Dail:** I mean, what's less popular than nothing...? \[laughter\] So handwritten, I guess that would include hand-rolled... I don't know. What is another one? I legitimately can't think of one. I guess -- this is a tough one. Maybe I'll just say like Create React App. It's not a static site generator, but... Maybe some people think of it.

**Jerod Santo:** Right... Remember that you're not trying to get the correct answer, you're trying to guess what people said. So you never know. Let's see if it's on there. Show us Create React App... \[fail sound\] Oh, I am sorry, but it did not quite make the list. It was mentioned one time, so somebody did say it.

**Brandon Dail:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** But that is three lives lost, which means team one now has the chance to steal the board. Team one, you can confer amongst yourselves, and discuss, and together pick one answer which will steal the board if it's on there.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** So I was thinking Gridsome or Nuxt...

**Nick Nisi:** I was thinking Jekyll.

**Michael Chan:** I was originally thinking like SvelteKit.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Jekyll... I didn't think about Jekyll.

**Michael Chan:** Any thoughts on Svelte?

**Nick Nisi:** Nobody thinks of Jekyll... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[unintelligible 00:15:55.05\] good sign, Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah. \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Well, yeah, SvelteKit... Hm.

**Nick Nisi:** I could agree with going with that one.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Sure. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[16:14\] Colby, what are you thinking? You've been pretty quiet up there.

**Colby Fayock:** Yeah, I think SvelteKit is interesting. I honestly thought that was gonna be higher, because I thought it was kind of growing... But I don't know.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Yeah, I thought Gridsome or Nuxt, but it's more Vue-centric than React-centric, so...

**Colby Fayock:** Yeah...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Yeah, let's roll the dice with SvelteKit...?

**Jerod Santo:** So far, team two has 74 points in this round.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I love how confident we are. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** The last item on the board is five points. So if this is correct, you'll steal 79 points from team two and be right back in the game. Show us SvelteKit. \[win sound\] Hey-hey! That's correct!

**Colby Fayock:** Yes! \[applause\]

**Jerod Santo:** Team one steals the round...

**Yuraima Estevez:** That one hurt.

**Jerod Santo:** ...and all points...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** This is how I do team projects in general; I have everybody do all the work and then I sweep right in there. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well played.

**Michael Chan:** That cuts deep...

**Jerod Santo:** So after two rounds, we have a very close game. Team one with 79 points, and team two with 92 points. Let's move now to the third round, which is an interface-off between Colby and Michael.

**Michael Chan:** Let's go!

**Yuraima Estevez:** Go Michael!

**Jerod Santo:** Team one gets to guess first. We asked 100 JS developers "Name a protocol that all web apps rely upon." Colby, to you.

**Colby Fayock:** HTTPS?

**Jerod Santo:** Show us HTTPS. \[win sound\] Number two answer, with 16 responses.

**Colby Fayock:** Number two answer...?

**Yuraima Estevez:** Number two?!

**Jerod Santo:** That means number one is still out there, and can be taken by Michael if you can guess it.

**Michael Chan:** I'm gonna go with HTTP, no S.

**Jerod Santo:** Oooh...! Despite the Letsencrypt folks' best efforts... \[laughter\]

**Colby Fayock:** The web is still insecure...

**Jerod Santo:** Still a lot of sites out there using plain old HTTP... But is it the number one answer? Let's find out. \[win sound\] It is. Overwhelmingly so, with 71 responses.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** We're so insecure...

**Michael Chan:** I would have said HTTP as well...

**Yuraima Estevez:** Yeah, not HTTP/2.

**Colby Fayock:** I was trying to be too best practices... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Right? So there are three responses on the board. You already have two. Team two is gonna play this board. We're gonna go to Brandon. Remember, that third one is usually the trickiest, so we'll see if you guys can make it before you lose all three lives.

**Michael Chan:** We believe in you.

**Brandon Dail:** I'm gonna say -- maybe there's a few more low-level-minded folks; maybe TCP?

**Jerod Santo:** Show us TCP. \[win sound\] Oh my goodness, you drilled it!

**Brandon Dail:** Yes!!

**Yuraima Estevez:** Low-level-minded folks sounds like such an insult. \[laughter\]

**Brandon Dail:** You know, people who just think about TCP all the time.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Five people said TCP/IP, even though those are two separate protocols, but let's not pick a nit here... That's correct, so yeah, you guys drilled it; this round was swept by team two, with lots of points available.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** No one's doing FTP anymore? Is that what I'm hearing?

**Yuraima Estevez:** FTP is dead. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** It appears that my scoreboard is busted; look at that, it says 179... That can't be right for this round.

**Brandon Dail:** I mean, we'll take it.

**Yuraima Estevez:** It's rigged, it's rigged.

**Brandon Dail:** We accept, we accept.

**Yuraima Estevez:** I call cahoots!

**Jerod Santo:** It'd be 71+16 -- I mean, it has to be less than a hundred, because there's only a hundred people surveyed... Ah, who coded this thing...?! So let me do a hard refresh real quick and see what happens. This might fix it. Team two... 71+16... Yaay, that's much better!

**Yuraima Estevez:** There you go.

**Jerod Santo:** I might have to hard-refresh each round. We'll see how this plays out. This is interesting. Alright, we're gonna award those points to team two... And now they lead, after three rounds, with 184, team one pulling up their rear with 79 points... But don't worry, there's lots of game left to play.

**Break:** \[20:22\]

**Jerod Santo:** We now move to round four, and our interface-off is between Tara and Brandon. Please step up. We surveyed 100 JavaScript developers and asked them to name a character trait that many successful developers have in common. There are five popular responses on the board. Brandon, you get to guess first.

**Brandon Dail:** I'm gonna go with curiosity.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us curiosity. \[win sound\] Number two answer, with 15 responses. So you're quite high on the board, but not at the top. Tara, if you can steal it... Guess that number one response.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Part of me wants to be a smart aleck and say coding, but... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** But how many smart alecks are out there?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I know, but that is probably one top developer trait in itself. Um, so maybe -- um, perseverance?

**Jerod Santo:** Show us perseverance. \[win sound\] So now you managed to pull it off. Number one answer

**Brandon Dail:** Oh, nice!

**Yuraima Estevez:** Wow. Okay.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I was a little nervous, since my job basically is me trying to know what developers are.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I do developer experience for a living, so \[unintelligible 00:22:46.24\]

**Jerod Santo:** You must be good at your job.

**Yuraima Estevez:** What even are developers...?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I know... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** This covered a range of words: grit, persistence, perseverance, stubbornness... All those words are basically wrapped up in that response. So Tara has won the board for team one. There are three responses left. We have one and two taken, three, four and five are still available. We go to Nick. Name a character trait that many successful devs have in common.

**Nick Nisi:** I am out of ideas here... Is tired a character trait? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Do you want me to test that one, or are you joking?

**Nick Nisi:** No, I'm joking... \[laughter\] Am I? Am I joking?

**Jerod Santo:** I know I'm tired, but am I joking...? \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** Um... I'm going to say... Everything I think of falls into those two categories, so... Um...

**Jerod Santo:** \[23:56\] Just do your best, Nick...

**Yuraima Estevez:** Look inside yourself and say "What am I?"

**Michael Chan:** Tired. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Do you wanna test "tired"? I'll test it for you. I have the tools at my disposal.

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah, test that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, let's see.

**Nick Nisi:** It's only one incorrect...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Show us "tired". \[fail sound\] No, of course not. Because it's not a characteristic trait. But it's definitely a status...

**Yuraima Estevez:** It's definitely what we all are, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so that's Nick we have one lost life. Colby, it is your turn. What's a character trait that many successful devs have in common?

**Colby Fayock:** Let's go with creative.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oooh...

**Jerod Santo:** Oooh... That one's like -- let's see, should I fit that in or not?

**Yuraima Estevez:** I like it.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me creative. \[win sound\] Number four answer; that's intelligent problem-solver, creative... People said "thinking outside the box", so it's all those kind of things. Right on the fringe of in there with intelligence, but we'll include it. So that's seven points. You now have numbers 1, 2 and 4. You're missing 3 and 5. And we go back to Tara; you have one lice loft -- one... I'm tired. \[laughter\] You have one life lost.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** You are one life, yes. Would innovative fit in that intelligence problem-solving one?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, I would say that's grouped in.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Son of a gun. Okay. Does hardworking fit? Or that would be in persistence.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I would group that one in as well.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Um... \[laughs\] Okay. Sorry, do I have a timer on me?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, if Nick is any indicator, no, you don't. \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I mean -- okay... So let's see. Teamwork? Is teamwork in any of these that's already there? I have to admit, this white font on yellow has hurt me a bit. I keep squinting at the words.

**Jerod Santo:** Teamwork is not currently listed on the board.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Teamwork? Collaboration? Yeah, teamwork/collaboration(ish).

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, that's a good guess. Show us good collaborator.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** You made the words better.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\] Sorry, but that was not one of the top five.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** So we're looking for 10x developers.

**Brandon Dail:** Is that saying something about successful developers? \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** That's what I was gonna say. Are we looking for 10x-ers here? Is that what is happening? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** So we have grit/persistence at number one, we've got curious and inquisitive at number two... At number four we have intelligence, problem-solving, thinking outside the box, being creative... We're missing 3 and 5. You have two lost lives already. Colby, this is your last chance. Can you name another trait that is on the popular board?

**Colby Fayock:** Just to be clear, wasn't it Nick who's next? Or am I next?

**Jerod Santo:** No, you're right, it's Nick. My apologies.

**Nick Nisi:** I see what you did there. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I was just trying to help your team out.

**Colby Fayock:** I don't wanna be the one to blame...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Nick...

**Nick Nisi:** You're feeding my imposter syndrome, and that was what I was gonna go with. They're imposters.

**Jerod Santo:** Ah, show us imposter syndrome. \[fail sound\] That was definitely mentioned, but it did not score five or more points. So team two now has an opportunity to steal the board. You can confer amongst yourselves and decide; you have two opportunities. If you can match either number three or number five, you steal these points.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oh, boy.

**Michael Chan:** Okay, so is this quote about laziness being one of the characteristics of a developer? I'm kind of feeling like that's one of those two, just because it's such a popular \[unintelligible 00:27:55.09\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** I'd +1 that.

**Brandon Dail:** Yeah. That's worth a shot.

**Yuraima Estevez:** For sure.

**Michael Chan:** Let's do it.

**Jerod Santo:** \[28:02\] Show us laziness. \[win sound\]

**Michael Chan:** Yes!

**Yuraima Estevez:** What?! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Team two steals the round.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** That's what a successful developer is. He is lazy! \[laughter\]

**Colby Fayock:** Lazy, but not tired...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** What is that saying about us? \[laughter\] I call my team a team of effective procrastinators, or successful procrastinators, functioning procrastinators...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, high-functioning procrastinators. Love it. \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Are we gonna know what the other one was? I'm really curious.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, I need to --

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Oh, sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** I need to do this score here, because I hit the wrong button. Give me a second.

**Brandon Dail:** 10x? It's 10x, isn't it?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** \[unintelligible 00:28:45.03\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oh, gosh...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** \[unintelligible 00:28:48.02\]

**Colby Fayock:** Didn't we already try that?

**Nick Nisi:** Nope. Wrong team. Right?

**Jerod Santo:** That's right, team 2 stole it. Yeah. I definitely have a bug in here, and I'm trying to debug it as we go. So the number 3 answer, with 8 points, was --

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Debugging should have been a trait.

**Jerod Santo:** ...effective communicator.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Communicator, yeah

**Jerod Santo:** So who was that -- was it Brandon that said that?

**Brandon Dail:** Yeah, that was gonna be my guess if I had another chance, so...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Yeah, that makes sense, that collaboration would fall into communicator...

**Jerod Santo:** Right, because that'd be like writing skills etc. Collaboration - you know, these things are related, but it's tough to group them effectively. A couple of people -- this is funny... So a couple of people said "humility", and then one person said "incredibly good looks." I thought that was a nice pairing, with humility... \[laughter\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** Clearly.

**Jerod Santo:** And then we did have a response that said "Complaining about HTML being a programming language or not." So there's your funny person trying to hop in there. \[laughter\] We'll leave that one right on the table, and we now move to round five. Round five is gonna work differently than other rounds...

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oh. Okay...

**Jerod Santo:** This is what we call the inverted round. So instead of having a face-off, we're going to have the teams rotate back and forth, guessing answers, and you're trying to guess the lowest answers on the board. There are six popular answers, but the points get higher and higher the further down the board. So what we try to do is match things that are on the board, but not number one, two and three, because they're worth less points.

So we asked 100 JS devs "Which day of the week do you get the most coding done?" and there are six answers on the board. Let's go ahead and start with the losing team, which is team one, and we'll start with Colby. Which day of the week do you get the most coding done? There are six potential answers.

**Colby Fayock:** So it has to be -- because they're six, and seven days, so it's not the least, right? So the second-least... Let's go with Saturday.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Saturday. \[fail sound\] No, you managed to find the least...

**Colby Fayock:** So it's not even on the board...

**Yuraima Estevez:** Dang...! \[laughter\] You over-succeeded, you overachieved there, Colby... \[laughter\]

**Colby Fayock:** Come on, isn't that bonus points?

**Jerod Santo:** You've found the one day that didn't even make it. Alright, we now go to team two. Let's go to Michael, for a chance to score here. Pick a day of the week.

**Michael Chan:** Okay, I'm gonna go with Friday -- um... Friday.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Friday. \[win sound\] Well played. Number five answer, which is 25 points. 11 people said Friday. It's the second least popular that's better than Saturday. \[laughter\] Alright, we go back now -- let's score those here... We go back to team one and Tara.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** So I'll go with Sunday.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Sunday. \[fail sound\] The plot thickens...

**Michael Chan:** What?!

**Yuraima Estevez:** What?!

**Jerod Santo:** \[32:15\] Sunday did not make the board, so neither Saturday, nor Sunday.

**Brandon Dail:** I guess these are people's responses, right?

**Jerod Santo:** These are people's responses.

**Brandon Dail:** So they don't have to be -- yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** We go back now to team two... \[laughter\]

**Michael Chan:** And we know dates are hard, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, we struggle with these things. \[laughter\] Alright, back now to team two. Let's go to Brandon.

**Brandon Dail:** Okay, so the weekend isn't even on here. I guess I'm gonna go Monday.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Monday. \[win sound\] Very good, right in the middle.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oh, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** 20 points awarded. You are fourth-highest response, with 12 responses. We're gonna award those points to team two. We go back to team one, and now we're on Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** Hm. So there are not days of the week, but other answers in here... \[laughter\] I'm gonna say meeting days.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us meeting days. \[fail sound\] I like that guess.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Hey, this team is consistent, I'll tell you that. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Thinking outside the box. Very creative; you'd be a good developer. \[laughter\] Alright, let's go to Yuraima.

**Yuraima Estevez:** I feel like this round makes absolutely no sense in my mind anymore... I'm gonna go with Wednesday, because those are my no-meeting days, and I always have meetings on those days.

**Jerod Santo:** So which day of the week do you get the most coding done? The guess is Wednesday. Is it on the board? \[win sound\] It sure is. It's the number two answer, meaning it's only worth ten points... But yet, still points. So you'll take it, right?

**Yuraima Estevez:** We'll take it.

**Jerod Santo:** We award those to team two. We go back to team one... Colby's turn, right?

**Colby Fayock:** Let's go "weekend".

**Jerod Santo:** Show us the weekend. \[fail sound\] \[laughter\] For a second there I felt like Daniel Craig on Saturday Night Live, when he says "Ladies and gentlemen... The weekend." \[unintelligible00:34:24.07\]

**Nick Nisi:** It was a good guess though.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** \[unintelligible 00:34:28.01\]

**Jerod Santo:** Sorry, team one, you guys are thinking outside the box, you have creative answers, and you're just striking out left and right... So team two tends to just pick days of the week, which is turning out to work pretty well. \[laughter\]

**Colby Fayock:** Let's see if it plays out in the end.

**Jerod Santo:** And is it Michael's turn now? I think so.

**Michael Chan:** I think so. You called out my strategy, because I was just gonna play it safe again, and just pick another day of the week... I'm trying to figure out which one might be worth the most points. I don't know... Let's just go Thursday.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us Thursday. \[win sound\] Number three answer. It's gonna get you 15 points.

**Michael Chan:** I'm amazed at how coordinated the not-day-of-the-week is. This is amazing.

**Jerod Santo:** So team two scores 15 there. We go back to team one. Let me just draw a word picture for our listeners... We have six options on the board. Number one hasn't been guessed, number six hasn't been guessed. What has been guesses is Wednesday, Thursday, Monday, Friday. I'll also tell you that Saturday and Sunday have also been guessed, as well as "weekend"... \[laughter\] So anything can happen at this point. And it's Tara's turn.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I mean, part of me wants to say "holiday". \[laughs\] But I feel like I should also go against the grain of my team and guess an actual day. \[laughter\]

**Brandon Dail:** If you do, we're gonna steal "holiday" and win.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Such a rebel, I know, I know... Um, let's try Tuesday. Let's see what happens there.

**Jerod Santo:** \[36:15\] Show us Tuesday. \[win sound\] Number one answer. 30 respondents find Tuesday to be when they get the most coding done, which puts it at only five points, because we're inverted... But points nonetheless. We'll award those to team one, and we'll go back to team two. And Brandon is up... There's only one last thing on the board. Are you gonna go for "holiday"? What's gonna happen here?

**Brandon Dail:** So literally every actual day of the week is out... \[laughter\] I'm gonna maybe account for the self-deprecating answer here and say "no days". None.

**Nick Nisi:** Oooh...!

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, very interesting.

**Nick Nisi:** Manager. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, let's see if our JS devs said they're productive no days... \[fail sound\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** So you know that Saturday and Sunday are supposed to be the strongest days, because the rest are weekdays...

**Brandon Dail:** Oooh...!

**Michael Chan:** Oooh...! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well played.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Epic.

**Jerod Santo:** I believe we're on Nick. Is that right, Nick? Are you ready for this?

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah... What else could there possibly be? \[laughs\] Wait, did somebody else guess holidays?

**Jerod Santo:** No, they just acted like they were gonna guess "holidays", but they didn't.

**Nick Nisi:** Okay.

**Colby Fayock:** And no one guessed Fri-yay... \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** No one said Black Friday either, yeah...

**Nick Nisi:** Let's do "holidays", and hope that if Black Friday is the day, that it's generic enough...

**Jerod Santo:** Show us "holidays". \[fail sound\] Wow... This is a stumper. We're back to Yuraima here... And almost everything that could be guessed has been guessed. \[laughter\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oh, man... Okay, so how many days are in a leap year? I'm doing those calculations in my head... \[laughter\]

**Brandon Dail:** Leap day?

**Yuraima Estevez:** Honestly, leap day might be it...

**Jerod Santo:** Is that your final answer?

**Yuraima Estevez:** ...to try to get those smartasses out there. Yeah, leap day, let's go for it.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us leap day.

**Brandon Dail:** We're with you.

**Colby Fayock:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\]

**Brandon Dail:** I would have given that one for you. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, in the sake of time, I will now provide a hint... And because team one is getting absolutely destroyed, I'll provide it to Colby. I would suggest maybe pulling an inverted Brandon.

**Colby Fayock:** I was gonna guess that anyway, so every day.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us every day... \[win sound\] Oh, there it is! Worth 40 points.

**Colby Fayock:** You gave a hint, so you took my credit... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Were you gonna guess that anyways?

**Colby Fayock:** I was, I was.

**Jerod Santo:** My bad, my bad. I should have given you a chance.

**Colby Fayock:** I looked at the nonsensical nature of every day being the day you get the most coding done. \[laughter\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** The most coding done, yes.

**Colby Fayock:** All day, every day.

**Yuraima Estevez:** On an anonymous survey. Like, yes, every single day. \[laughter\]

**Colby Fayock:** That is very programmer.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** It totally is. Aren't most devs supposed to be good at logic?

**Colby Fayock:** Every day is the most.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Yeah, exactly. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so 30 points awarded to team one there. That ends our inverted round.

**Break:** \[39:39\]

**Jerod Santo:** We now move to our final two rounds. These are worth double points, and the teams get to decide who does the face-off. So we will now go to round six, that's worth double points. Team 1, who would you like to represent you in your face-off?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I say we stick with the luck of the Colby.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so Colby is on team 1. How about team 2? Who would like to face-off?

**Brandon Dail:** I nominate Michael. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** We have a nomination.

**Michael Chan:** A quick draw nomination. I should have spoke sooner. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** There's a nomination, a second, and \[unintelligible 00:41:45.18\] So that's official. Let's move to round six. Gentlemen, step right up. We asked 100 JavaScript developers "What's the first thing you do when your code doesn't work right?" Since team 1 is trailing, we'll let Colby guess first.

**Colby Fayock:** I feel like I could come up with a lot of smart answers for this, but console log.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us console log. \[win sound\] Number one answer...

**Nick Nisi:** Nice!

**Yuraima Estevez:** Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** ...with 16 respondents, but it is the double round, so that is worth 32 points, and Michael doesn't even get a chance, and your team takes the board. So you're off to a good start in round 6. We now go to Tara. There are five answers. You've got number one, which means there's four remaining. What is the first thing you do when your code doesn't work right?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Is dev tools too broad? Like, inspect --

**Jerod Santo:** It's a good question... I would say yes, too broad.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Too broad. But inspect the code with dev tools is also too broad? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** What are you trying to saying here?

**Brandon Dail:** \[unintelligible 00:43:07.00\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, yeah. You've gotta guess one at some point. \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** This is my communicative debugging... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You can guess that and find out.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** That feels like a bait... What about running a debugger in code? It's like, debug?

**Jerod Santo:** Debug. Final answer?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Show me debug. \[win sound\] Number four answer. Use the debugger. 11 respondents, worth 22 points. So you have one and four. Two, three and four remain. Nick, it is your turn.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright, so not the correct answer, but what the most people guessed. I'm gonna say "You run the code again."

**Michael Chan:** Refresh. \[laughter\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** Hard refresh.

**Jerod Santo:** Kind of like I did earlier, when I refreshed \[unintelligible 00:44:05.02\] Show us "Re-run the code." \[win sound\]

**Nick Nisi:** \[44:15\] Yes!

**Jerod Santo:** Number two answer. This includes "Refresh the page" or "Re-run the code." 15 respondents, which gives you 30 points. You're raking up the points in this round.

**Nick Nisi:** I finally got one right. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** And you haven't lost any lives yet.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** We had total faith in you.

**Jerod Santo:** We're back to Colby, and there's two more things.

**Colby Fayock:** Check tests?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Yeah, are we talking about the lazy coders, or are we talking about --

**Jerod Santo:** Show me "check tests." \[fail sound\]

**Colby Fayock:** I guess lazy coders... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Checking tests did not make the cut. That's your first life lost. Back to Tara.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** So like part of me would want to say you rubber duck your co-workers, but we know from the first respondents that nobody works \[unintelligible 00:44:58.29\] and collaborates.

**Yuraima Estevez:** No. \[laughter\]

**Brandon Dail:** So that's the physical rubber-duck, right?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Yes, yes... \[laughs\] So I guess I wanna go with the smart alecks and say something like cry... \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** That was gonna be my guess...

**Yuraima Estevez:** Just sobbing at the computer... \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Yeah. Whine, cry, and sob, yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us cry. \[win sound\] Number three answer, which includes swearing, crying, or sighing. \[laughter\]

**Brandon Dail:** I like that more people cry that use the debugger. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, it's an order of operations thing, right? The first thing you do is cry. Then you reach for a debugger.

**Brandon Dail:** \[unintelligible 00:45:42.11\] crying, yeah.

**Colby Fayock:** The five stages of debugging...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Exactly. \[laughter\] Yeah, is number five "All of the above"? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you do have numbers 1 through 4 correct; you've lost only one life, which means you have two guesses to get that tricky fifth slot... And is it now Nick's turn...? Back to Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah. I'm going to say that you check out or revert.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us revert. \[fail sound\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Aww... Because that's the smart thing to do, huh? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Sorry, that did not make the cut. We now go to Colby. You're down to your last guess.

**Colby Fayock:** So I'm trying to decide -- because I was gonna say "Delete the code." But would "Delete the code" be too similar to revert? Because technically, they're different, right?

**Jerod Santo:** I would just say they're probably too close. You should fish elsewhere.

**Colby Fayock:** Well, thank you. \[laughter\] But keep fishing, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** That was good fishing though...

**Colby Fayock:** Comment things out.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us comment things out. \[fail sound\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Aww...

**Michael Chan:** Yes! Is that us?

**Jerod Santo:** That is your third lost life, which means it's now a chance to steal, team 2.

**Brandon Dail:** We know what it is, right?

**Jerod Santo:** What is it?

**Brandon Dail:** Oh, do we get to confer?

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Such confidence...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you can confer.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oh, yeah.

**Brandon Dail:** Alright, we know that there's people who said they write the most code every single day... \[laughter\] So are there people who would say that their code always works? \[laughter\]

**Michael Chan:** Wow... I was thinking google "Stack Overflow".

**Brandon Dail:** That's more reasonable, yeah.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Yeah, that's a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** Is that your final answer?

**Yuraima Estevez:** I'd go with googling, yeah. +1.

**Brandon Dail:** Yeah. Look it up.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, show us "google it", for the steal! \[fail sound\]

**Brandon Dail:** What?!

**Yuraima Estevez:** Aww...!

**Brandon Dail:** I'm sorry, team. I'm sorry.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I mean, that wasn't really --

**Jerod Santo:** That means team 1 is awarded the points.

**Yuraima Estevez:** That was a good guess.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Maybe when they say that the most productive code - that's where that falls into, is copying and pasting.

**Brandon Dail:** \[48:03\] I thought for sure -- the whole time, I was like "Just don't guess it, because we got this", but wow. Wow. That's rough.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** It's gotta be a smart aleck answer. This is gonna be where Sunday shows up. It's just gonna be like "Sunday." \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I will say, this is a somewhat obvious one, so I'm wondering if maybe somebody said it roundabout and I said it was wrong... But the number five response, with ten people stating it, was "Check the logs", or "Check the error messages."

**Brandon Dail:** I don't think anybody said that...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Yeah, because that kind of falls in the dev tools --

**Jerod Santo:** When you said -- I mean, debugging is kind of there; add a console log... But they specifically said "read the logs", "read the error messages", so I separated that one out. A couple of funny answers, when your code doesn't work right - somebody said "Ship it to prod." \[laughter\] So, I guess, don't hire that person... \[laughter\] One person said "Listen to a podcast about it", which we appreciate, but is that really gonna do any good? I don't know. One funny one - do a casual desk flip... I thought "Okay..."

**Brandon Dail:** Casual...

**Jerod Santo:** Casual. You know, like, not the angry desk flip, but just like the --

**Colby Fayock:** Just smooth and easy...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** It's just two fingers? Yeah... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** A two-finger desk flip. \[laughter\] And then, of course, Brandon was on the right track, because two people said "My code always works."

**Brandon Dail:** Wow.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Wow...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Those are the ones that also answered "lazy" is the best trait to have. \[laughter\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** For sure.

**Jerod Santo:** So after six rounds we have a tight race once again. The double points brought team 1 back. You have 272 points. Team 2 has 301 points... So it's anybody's game. We go into our final round... This is double the score, just like last time around. Once again, you get to pick your contestants for the interface-off. Team 1, who would you like?

**Colby Fayock:** Yuraima.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oh, gosh.

**Colby Fayock:** If you're okay with it.

**Yuraima Estevez:** I'll do it. \[laughter\]

**Colby Fayock:** You got the quick-draw this time.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** My team didn't ask me that... \[laughter\]

**Brandon Dail:** Would you like to do it...? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** "Would you be our captain?" Alright, Tara and Yuraima, step right up. We will let Yuraima guess first this time.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I feel like we need to do the virtual handshake.

**Yuraima Estevez:** The virtual handshake, yes. Good luck, good luck.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yuraima, please name one thing that React devs commonly argue about.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oh... Functional versus class components.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us "functional versus class components." \[win sound\] That was the number five answer, with six respondents, worth 12 points. That does mean that Tara gets a chance to guess.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I'm so nervous, because I've been out of the React realm for so long... But is it still a debate about where CSS goes?

**Brandon Dail:** We're all still arguing about the same things... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Show us "Where the CSS goes." \[win sound\] Number three answer, CSS-in-JS, and other such things.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Oh...!

**Brandon Dail:** It was a good one. It's like the Freudian stages of the React developer, and you get stuck in one for forever... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** So with that, Tara answered the higher response, so team one takes the board, and there are three responses still on the board - one, two and four. So we go to team one, and Nick, it is now your turn. Name one thing that React devs commonly argue about.

**Nick Nisi:** I'm gonna say the language, like TypeScript, JavaScript...

**Jerod Santo:** \[51:59\] I knew you would say that. Show us "TypeScript". \[win sound\] Yes, of course, TypeScript vs. JavaScript. Number two answer, with 11 responses. Okay, the comeback continues. Colby, you have 1 in 4 open, and you have all three of your lives left. Name something that React devs argue about.

**Colby Fayock:** Hooks.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us hooks. \[fail sound\]

**Michael Chan:** Whoa!

**Nick Nisi:** It was a good guess.

**Jerod Santo:** That one was definitely mentioned, but not five or more times. So that's their first life lost. We go back to Tara.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I wanna be a smart aleck again and just say that they're arguing against each other that React is the best framework ever... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Like, how \[unintelligible 00:52:46.13\]

**Colby Fayock:** Every day the most... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Every day...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Gosh... I guess -- I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you have two lives to live, so you could definitely just throw one out there and hope that you hit it.

**Nick Nisi:** Because then it's going to me. I wouldn't do that...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Brandon Dail:** I have faith in both of you. \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I can't keep it broad, like structured, like keeping stateful stuff separate, and structure, or like --

**Brandon Dail:** Yeah, that'd probably component style.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I always have the most broad answers... Yeah, and then naming conventions... Um, let's see... I'm sorry, let's say -- I feel like there's gotta be a smart aleck one in here... Like tabs versus spaces, or something ridiculous. Is syntax too broad, too?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** You mean the Syntax podcast? Way too broad...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Um... Okay, sorry. I wanna be the smart aleck and say that -- let's just say... Oh, gosh, I'm sorry...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, you've said four of them, and they're all worth guessing...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I don't know why this is so stressful...

**Jerod Santo:** Just pick one of those.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Let's say file naming conventions, like capitalizations and whatever.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, show us "naming conventions". \[fail sound\] Not quite. It definitely had a couple of mentions.

**Brandon Dail:** I thought that was a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** That was a good one. So you're down to your last guess, and you're down to Nick Nisi, and that's never a great place to be, but here you are... \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** This is where he was gonna shine. I don't know what you're talking about. He's been waiting for his moment.

**Jerod Santo:** He drilled that TypeScript one. Nick lives for TypeScript answers.

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah. I have two guesses, but I don't know which one is better given the respondent audience.

**Jerod Santo:** Mm-hm...

**Nick Nisi:** I will say state management.

**Jerod Santo:** Show us state management... \[win sound\] Number one answer...!

**Nick Nisi:** Yes! \[applause\]

**Jerod Santo:** Right when I disrespect you, you just step up to the plate. \[laughter\] Well played, sir.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Just do that more, Jerod. Every time he goes to answer.

**Yuraima Estevez:** He had to prove you wrong. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we're back to Colby...

**Colby Fayock:** If you have that other answer, I'll take that... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Colby, you have one life to live...

**Colby Fayock:** Let's go with performance.

**Jerod Santo:** This will be for the winning of the entire game... Show us "performance". \[fail sound\] I'm sorry, it was not on the list, which means team 2 has a chance to steal. There is one answer left, number four. Team 2 can confer amongst yourselves. What's one thing that React devs commonly argue about?

**Michael Chan:** What are some things you're thinking? Just shout them out.

**Yuraima Estevez:** File structure.

**Brandon Dail:** JSX? Some people don't like --

**Yuraima Estevez:** JSX...

**Michael Chan:** That is a good one. Yeah, I was thinking like suffixes too, like we were talking about earlier... Linting also too, I was thinking about... Like linting rules and whatnot.

**Yuraima Estevez:** \[56:17\] Go super-broad and say Facebook. \[laughter\]

**Michael Chan:** Yeah, like licensing?

**Jerod Santo:** That's actually a pretty good point.

**Michael Chan:** Yeah, that's great.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I mean, do React devs even argue that much? Is that really a thing?

**Nick Nisi:** Never. \[laughter\]

**Brandon Dail:** We don't get along...

**Yuraima Estevez:** Not ever...

**Brandon Dail:** I really do like the idea of governance. That is a really interesting concept. You know, like the Facebook relationship. There's a bunch of licensing stuff... That's tough. I don't know. I could go any one of these ways.

**Jerod Santo:** What are you thinking, Brandon?

**Brandon Dail:** I mean, I think the licensing stuff is maybe not like a popular point of contention for most people... And when they re-licensed years ago, it's kind of faded. I don't know, I could do linting, we could do -- I think JSX is just very controversial, so I think there'll always be people who are talking about it... But gosh, I don't know.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Jerod has such a good poker face, too. \[unintelligible 00:57:22.28\]

**Jerod Santo:** I will remind you, the game is on the line...

**Brandon Dail:** Yeah, this is really heavy.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I'm just enjoying the drama...

**Brandon Dail:** I think Tara had guessed file structure, or something along that vein; probably something close enough. Or someone on team one...

**Jerod Santo:** She landed on naming conventions.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Naming conventions.

**Brandon Dail:** Oh, naming conventions.

**Colby Fayock:** I really love how analytical you're being with the notes... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, Michael really has notes that he's reading from.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** He's got a whole flow chart over there... \[laughter\] He's looked up our backgrounds, he has a whole --

**Michael Chan:** Yeah, just \[unintelligible 00:57:58.27\] connecting theories together... \[laughter\] I do like -- if we think it's different enough, I do like the file system organization, if we think it's different enough.

**Colby Fayock:** They feel close to me, but...

**Michael Chan:** They do feel close.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Close, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you have any others?

**Michael Chan:** Well, I feel like that was a hint.

**Jerod Santo:** No, I just wanna know. \[laughter\] Well, I did give Tara and Colby some pretty sweet hints throughout, so...

**Nick Nisi:** He just confirmed it's a hint...

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe a little bit of a bone there. Yeah, I think those two are pretty close together.

**Michael Chan:** Okay.

**Brandon Dail:** Routing? I don't know. I guess React Router is pretty much the answer, but... We'll still argue about it

**Yuraima Estevez:** Um, testing library? Ways to test...?

**Michael Chan:** Yeah, the whole Enzyme React testing library... Yeah, that could be there. I wonder if there's like a React/React Native... I don't know. I'm at a loss. The stakes are too high; I'm freaking out.

**Yuraima Estevez:** They're so high.

**Brandon Dail:** Our shout-outs are on the line here. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** This is true. \[laughs\]

**Brandon Dail:** I need this!

**Nick Nisi:** It's such a good guess...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, we're gonna have to land somewhere...

**Michael Chan:** Alright, does anyone have any strong feelings towards one of those? I'm so in the middle...

**Brandon Dail:** Testing feels like a safe potential answer...

**Yuraima Estevez:** Testing feels safe(ish).

**Michael Chan:** Yeah, I like that. Let's print it. Ship it.

**Brandon Dail:** Let's just do it.

**Jerod Santo:** Ship it? Alright. Just to set the stage... The score is team one 272, team two 301. There are 82 points scored already this round, so whoever wins this round, wins... And if you steal this, you steal the entire round and all points. This is the number four answer. You guessed testing.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** The suspense...

**Jerod Santo:** Is it on the board? Show us testing. \[fail sound\]

**Brandon Dail:** Aww!

**Yuraima Estevez:** Nooo!

**Michael Chan:** Aww! \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I feel so bad for your sound editor, because my chair is really squeaky, and I've just been like \[unintelligible 01:00:21.26\] \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:00:26.01\] Unfortunately, I'm also our sound editor, so... I appreciate your empathy. Well, team one - congratulations. After all that, you win with 354 points.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** The underdog \[unintelligible 01:00:40.11\] \[applause\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** Wow...

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** It start with thievery. That's how you win it. \[laughter\] That's how you get ahead in life.

**Brandon Dail:** Great developers steal.

**Jerod Santo:** I had to be a little bit tickled as you guys were discussing these various steals, because it turns out Tara had landed on it, smart aleck style, earlier on, and then quickly dismissed it. The number four answer, "tabs versus spaces."

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Ooooh...! \[laughs\]

**Yuraima Estevez:** Aww, man....!

**Brandon Dail:** Oh, my gosh. That's ridiculous.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Why is that still an argument? it's obviously spaces.

**Brandon Dail:** Oh, wow. You went there. \[laughter\]

**Michael Chan:** How much time do we have left?

**Jerod Santo:** Why don't I introduce you to Nick Nisi? \[laughter\] ...who will follow on the other side of that, and on the wrong side of the fence, every time.

**Michael Chan:** Now you've just made it personal. It was a joke before, and now...! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** So team 1, you guys win. That means you get to do shout-outs. So all three of you each get an opportunity to shout-out anything that you would like. It cannot be TypeScript. Nick, you are up. What would you like to shout out?

**Nick Nisi:** Well, I already shouted out \[unintelligible 01:01:49.15\] at the beginning, so... \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I prefer mine solid, but whatever...

**Nick Nisi:** \[laughs\] Let's see... I'm going to shout out the...

**Jerod Santo:** Do you want us to come back?

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Colby, give us a shout-out.

**Colby Fayock:** How about Tara start, so I can hear what the other people say first? \[laughter\]

**Michael Chan:** Man, nobody even wants to shout out.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I'm gonna be giving this to team two.

**Michael Chan:** We'll take 'em!

**Jerod Santo:** It's like the worst prize ever. They're like "I can't think of anything!" Tara, do you have anything to shout out? It could be literally anything.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** I have lots of things to shout out, but I will limit it to something productive... And go with one of my favorite things in the world right now - it's our podcast, for all you podcast fans out there. It's called Remotely Interesting. Remotelyinteresting.netlify.com. We basically make complete fools of ourselves and have a good time doing it, and laugh a lot, and it's kind of ridiculous. But I highly recommend checking it out, for all you lazy devs out there.

**Yuraima Estevez:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go. Good shout-out. Remotely Interesting. Well, she stalled as long as she could. Does either of you have a shout-out? \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** Um... Colby? \[laughter\]

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** \[unintelligible 01:03:08.26\] so much more...

**Colby Fayock:** Check me out on YouTube at @colbyfayock.

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Nick Nisi:** Nice.

**Colby Fayock:** Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Nick would like to shout out tabs as a way of indenting. \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** Because state management was the number one pick in the last round, I will say XState. I'm gonna shout out XState. It's awesome. Go check it out.

**Jerod Santo:** And I will add my Amen to that by saying check out the episode that Nick did of JS Party on XState. It's called "X gonna state it to you." \[laughter\] Nick also came up with that name. And stick around to the end of that episode for a little bit of a Easter Egg, where you might get some DMX mixed in with some other interesting sounds. Alright, so --

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Oh, my gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** So piling on to the shout-outs there, I wanna shout out to React Advanced for inviting us to play this game as part of the after-party. Hopefully, all of you had as much fun listening and participating as we had playing. Thank you to each and every person who took the survey. One of you will be receiving a free JS Party T-shirt, so we'll follow up via email with that person. That means 99 of you will not win a JS Party T-shirt, but have no fear, you can always head to jsparty.fm/merch and just pick one up for yourself. They are very comfy, and you can rep our podcast out there IRL, in the meet spaces.

I also just wanted to thank everybody for playing the game. This has been Frontend Feud. I have been Jerod Santo, and we'll talk to y'all next time.

**Tara Z. Manicsic:** Thank you...!

**Yuraima Estevez:** Thanks, y'all.

**Brandon Dail:** \[unintelligible 01:04:46.18\] This was fun!

**Yuraima Estevez:** Bye! \[laughter\]

**Outro:** \[01:04:53.05\]

**Horse JS:** JavaScript’s security model is based.
